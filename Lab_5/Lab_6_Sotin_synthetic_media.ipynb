justify to the lamb the wolf’s right to eat him . he thus addressed him : sirrah , last year you grossly insulted me . indeed , bleated the lamb in a mournful tone of voice , i was not then born . then said the wolf , you feed in my pasture . no , good sir , replied the lamb , i have not yet tasted grass . again said the wolf , you drink of my well . no , exclaimed the lamb , i never yet drank water , for as yet my mother’s milk is both food and drink to me . upon which the wolf seized him and ate him up , saying , well ! i won’t remain supperless , even though you refute every one of my imputations . the tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the bat and the weasels . a bat who fell upon the ground and was caught by a weasel pleaded to be spared his life . the weasel refused , saying that he was by nature the enemy of all birds . the bat assured him that he was not a bird , but a mouse , and thus was set free . shortly afterwards the bat again fell to the ground and was caught by another weasel , whom he likewise entreated not to eat him . the weasel said that he had a special hostility to mice . the bat assured him that he was not a mouse , but a bat , and thus a second time escaped . it is wise to turn circumstances to good account . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass and the grasshopper . an ass having heard some grasshoppers chirping , was highly enchanted ; and , desiring to possess the same charms of melody , demanded what sort of food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices . they replied , the dew . the ass resolved that he would live only upon dew , and in a short time died of hunger . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lion and the mouse . a lion was awakened from sleep by a mouse running over his face . rising up angrily , he caught him and was about to kill him , when the mouse piteously entreated , saying : if you would only spare my life , i would be sure to repay your kindness . the lion laughed and let him go . it happened shortly after this that the lion was caught by some hunters , who bound him by strong ropes to the ground . the mouse , recognizing his roar , came and gnawed the rope with his teeth , and set him free , exclaiming : . you ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you , not expecting to receive from me any repayment of your favor ; now you know that it is possible for even a mouse to confer benefits on a lion . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the charcoal - burner and the fuller . a charcoal -

he next opened the faggot , took the sticks separately , one by one , and again put them into his sons’ hands , upon which they broke them easily . he then addressed them in these words : my sons , if you are of one mind , and unite to assist each other , you will be as this faggot , uninjured by all the attempts of your enemies ; but if you are divided among yourselves , you will be broken as easily as these sticks . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the boy hunting locusts . a boy was hunting for locusts . he had caught a goodly number , when he saw a scorpion , and mistaking him

forest . not long afterwards , as he ascended a small hillock , he saw at its foot a lion feeding on the calf . terrified at the sight , he lifted his eyes and his hands to heaven , and said : just now i vowed to offer a lamb to the guardian deities of the forest if i could only find out who had robbed me ; but now that i have discovered the thief , i would willingly add a full - grown bull to the calf i have lost , if i may only secure my own escape from him in safety . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the hare and the tortoise . a hare one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace

, and let me go free this once . my broken limb should excite your pity . besides , i am no crane , i am a stork , a bird of excellent character ; and see how i love and slave for my father and mother . look too , at my feathers - - they are not the least like those of a crane . the farmer laughed aloud and said , it may be all as you say , i only know this : i have taken you with these robbers ,

leisure . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the tortoise and the eagle . a tortoise , lazily basking in the sun , complained to the sea - birds of her hard fate , that no one would teach her to fly . an eagle , hovering near , heard her lamentation and demanded what reward she would give him if he would take her aloft and float her in the air . i will give you , . she said , all the riches of the red sea . i will teach you to fly then , said the eagle ; and taking her up in his talons he carried her almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go , and she fell on a lofty mountain , dashing her shell to pieces . the tortoise exclaimed in the moment of death : i have deserved my present fate ; for what had i to do with wings and clouds , who can with difficulty move about on the earth ? .

hurts . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the man and the lion . a man and a lion traveled together through the forest . they soon began to boast of their respective superiority to each other in

, and how we prevail over even the king of beasts . the lion replied : this statue was made by one of you men . if we lions knew how to erect statues , you would see the man placed under the paw of the lion . one story is good , till another is told . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the farmer and the cranes . some cranes made their feeding grounds on some plowlands newly sown with wheat . for a long time the farmer , brandishing an empty sling , chased them away by the terror he inspired ; but when the birds found that the sling was only swung in the air , they ceased to take any notice of it and would not move . the farmer , on seeing this , charged his sling with stones , and killed a great number . the remaining birds at once forsook his fields , crying to each other , it is time for us to be off to liliput : for this man is no longer content to scare us , but begins to show us in earnest what he can do . if words suffice not , blows must follow . | | | | | | | | | | |

deep well and could find no means of escape . a goat , overcome with thirst , came to the same well , and seeing the fox , inquired if the water was good . concealing his sad plight under a merry guise , the fox indulged in a lavish praise of the water , saying it was excellent beyond measure , and encouraging him to descend . the goat , mindful only of his thirst , thoughtlessly jumped down , but just as he drank , the fox informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape . if , said he , you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head , i will run up your back and escape , and will help you out afterwards . the goat readily assented and the fox leaped upon his back . steadying himself with the goat’s horns , he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could . when the goat upbraided him for breaking his promise , he turned around and cried out , you foolish old fellow ! if you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard , you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up , nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape . look before you leap . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the bear and the two travelers . two men were traveling together , when a bear suddenly met them on their path . one of them climbed up quickly into a tree and concealed himself in the branches . the other , seeing that he must be attacked , fell flat on the ground , and when the bear came up and felt him with his snout , and smelt him all over , he held his breath , and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could . the bear soon left him , for it is said he will not touch a dead body . when he was quite gone , the other traveler descended from the tree , and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the bear had whispered in his ear . he gave me this advice , his companion replied . never travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger . misfortune tests the sincerity of friends . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the oxen and the axle - trees . a heavy wagon was being dragged along a country lane by a team of oxen . the axle - trees groaned and creaked terribly ; whereupon the oxen , turning round , thus addressed the wheels : hullo there ! why do you make so much noise ? we bear

saw a goblet of water painted on a signboard . not supposing it to be only a picture , she flew towards it with a loud whir and unwittingly dashed against the signboard , jarring herself terribly .

swan . a raven saw a swan and desired to secure for himself the same beautiful plumage . supposing that the swan’s splendid white color arose from his washing in the water in which he swam , the raven

while through want of food he perished . change of habit cannot alter nature . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the goat and the goatherd . a goatherd had sought to bring back a stray goat to

miser sold all that he had and bought a lump of gold , which he buried in a hole in the ground by the side of an old wall and went to look at daily . one of his workmen observed his frequent visits to the spot and decided to watch his movements . he soon discovered the secret of the hidden treasure , and digging down , came to the lump of gold , and stole it . the miser , on his next visit , found the hole empty and began to tear his hair and to make loud lamentations . a neighbor , seeing him overcome with grief and learning the cause , said , pray do not grieve so ; but go and take a stone , and place it in the hole , and fancy that the gold is still lying there . it will do you quite the same service ; for when the gold was there , you had it not , as you did not make the slightest use of it . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the sick lion . a lion , unable from old age and infirmities to provide himself with food by force , resolved to do so by artifice . he returned to his den , and lying down there , pretended to be sick , taking care that his sickness should be publicly known . the beasts expressed their sorrow , and came one by one to his den , where the lion devoured them . after many of the beasts had thus disappeared , the fox discovered the trick and presenting himself to the lion , stood on the outside of the cave , at a respectful distance , and asked him how he was . i am very middling , replied the lion , but why do you stand without ? pray enter within to talk with me . no , thank you , said the fox . i notice that there are many prints of feet entering your cave , but i see no trace of any returning . he is wise who is warned by the misfortunes of others . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the horse and groom . a groom used to spend whole days in currycombing and rubbing down his horse , but at the same time stole his oats and sold them for his own profit . alas ! said the horse , if you really wish me to be in good

left in a stable and had plenty of oats and hay to eat , just as any other ass would . the lapdog knew many tricks and was a great favorite with his master , who often fondled him and seldom went out to dine without bringing him home some tidbit to eat . the ass , on the contrary , had much work to do in grinding the corn - mill and in carrying wood from the forest or burdens from the farm . he often lamented his own hard fate and contrasted it with the luxury and idleness of the lapdog , till at last one day he broke his cords and halter , and galloped into his master’s house , kicking up his heels without measure , and frisking and fawning as well as he could . he next tried to jump about his master as he had seen the lapdog do , but he broke the table and smashed all the dishes upon it to atoms . he then attempted to lick his master , and jumped upon his back . the servants , hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their master , quickly relieved him , and drove out the ass to his stable with kicks and clubs and cuffs . the ass , as he returned to his stall beaten nearly to death , thus lamented : i have brought it all on myself ! why could i not have been contented to labor with my companions , and not wish to be idle all the day like that useless little lapdog ! | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lioness . a controversy prevailed among the beasts of the field as to which of the animals deserved the most credit for producing the greatest number of whelps at a birth . they rushed clamorously into the presence of the lioness and demanded of her the settlement of the dispute . and you , . they said , how many sons have you at a birth ? the lioness laughed at them , and said : why ! i have only one ; but that one is altogether a thoroughbred lion . the value is in the worth , not in the number . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the boasting traveler . a man who had traveled in foreign lands boasted very much , on

. the lion cheerfully assented to the proposal . but when the toothless , clawless lion returned to repeat his request , the woodman , no longer afraid , set upon him with his club , and drove him away into the forest . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the laborer and the snake . a snake , having made his hole close to the porch of a cottage , inflicted a mortal bite on the cottager’s

and cut off only the end of its tail . after some time the cottager , afraid that the snake would bite him also , endeavored to make peace , and placed some bread and salt in the hole . the snake , slightly hissing , said : there can henceforth be no peace between us ; for whenever i see you i shall remember the loss of my tail , and whenever you see me you will be thinking of the death of your son . no one truly forgets injuries in the presence of him who caused the injury . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wolf in sheep’s clothing . once upon a time a wolf resolved to disguise

instead of a sheep , and killed him instantly . harm seek , harm find . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass and the mule . a muleteer set forth on a journey , driving before him an ass and

could bear . he entreated his companion to relieve him of a small portion , that he might carry home the rest ; but the mule paid no attention to the request . the ass shortly afterwards fell down dead under his burden . not knowing what else to do in so wild a region , the muleteer placed upon the mule the load carried by the ass in addition to his own , and at the top of all placed the hide of the ass , after he had skinned him . the mule , groaning beneath his heavy burden , said to himself : i am treated according to my deserts . if i had only been willing to assist the ass a little in his need , i should not now be bearing , together with his burden , himself as well . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the frogs asking for a king . the frogs , grieved at having no established

themselves in the depths of the pool . but as soon as they realized that the huge log was motionless , they swam again to the top of the water , dismissed their fears , climbed up , and began squatting on it in contempt . after some time they began to think themselves ill - treated in the appointment of so inert a ruler , and sent a second deputation to jupiter to pray that he would set over them another sovereign . he then gave them an eel to govern them . when the frogs discovered his easy good nature , they sent yet a third time to jupiter to beg him to choose for them still another king . jupiter , displeased with all their complaints , sent a heron , who preyed upon the frogs day by day till there were none left to croak upon the lake . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |

his ass to the seashore to buy salt . his road home lay across a stream into which his ass , making a false step , fell by accident and rose up again with his load considerably lighter , as the water melted the sack . the peddler retraced his steps and refilled his panniers with a larger quantity of salt than before . when he came again to the stream , the ass fell down on purpose in the same spot , and , regaining his feet with the weight of his load much diminished , brayed triumphantly as if he had obtained what he desired . the peddler saw through his trick and drove him for the third time to the coast , where he bought a cargo of sponges instead of salt . the ass , again playing the fool , fell down on purpose when he reached the stream , but the sponges became swollen with water , greatly increasing his load . and thus his trick recoiled on him , for he now carried on his back a double burden . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the oxen and the butchers . the oxen once upon a time sought to destroy the butchers , who practiced a trade destructive to their race . they assembled on a certain day to carry out their purpose , and sharpened their horns for the contest . but one of them who was exceedingly old ( for many a field had he plowed ) thus spoke : these butchers , it is true , slaughter us , but they do so with skillful hands , and with no unnecessary pain . if we get rid of them , we shall fall into the hands of unskillful operators , and thus suffer a double death : for you may be assured , that though all the butchers should perish , yet will men never want beef . do not be in a hurry to change one evil for another . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lion , the mouse , and the fox . a lion , fatigued by the heat of a summer’s day , fell fast asleep in his den . a mouse ran over his mane and ears and woke him from his slumbers . he rose up and shook himself in great wrath , and searched every corner of his den to find the mouse . a fox seeing him said : a fine lion you are , to be frightened of a mouse . ‘tis not the mouse i fear , said the lion ; i resent his familiarity and ill - breeding . little liberties are great offenses . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the vain jackdaw . jupiter determined , it is said , to create a sovereign over the birds , and made proclamation that on a certain day they should all present themselves before him , when he would himself choose the most beautiful among them to be king . the jackdaw , knowing his own ugliness , searched through the woods and fields , and collected the feathers which had fallen from the wings of his companions , and stuck them in all parts of his body , hoping thereby to make himself the most beautiful of all . when the appointed day arrived , and the birds had assembled before jupiter , the jackdaw also made his appearance in his many feathered finery . but when jupiter proposed to make him king because of the beauty of his plumage , the birds indignantly protested , and each plucked from him his own feathers , leaving the jackdaw nothing but a jackdaw . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the goatherd and the wild goats . a goatherd , driving his flock from their pasture at eventide , found some wild goats mingled among them , and shut them up together with his own for the night . the next day it snowed very hard , so that he could not take the herd to their usual feeding places , but was obliged to keep them in the fold . he gave his own goats just sufficient food to keep them alive , but fed the strangers more abundantly in the hope of enticing them to stay with him and of making them his own . when the thaw set in , he led them all out to feed , and the wild goats scampered away as fast as they could to the mountains . the goatherd scolded them for their ingratitude in leaving him , when during the storm he had taken more care of them than of his own herd . one of them , turning about , said to him : that is the very reason why we are so cautious ; for if you yesterday treated us better than the goats you have had so long , it is plain also that if others came after us , you would in the same manner prefer them to ourselves . old friends cannot with impunity be sacrificed for new ones . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the mischievous dog . a dog used to run up quietly to the heels of everyone he met , and to bite them without notice . his master suspended a bell about his neck so that the dog might give notice of his presence wherever he went . thinking it a mark of distinction , the dog grew proud of his bell and went tinkling it all over the marketplace . one day an old hound said to him : why do you make such an exhibition of yourself ? that bell that you carry is not , believe me , any order of merit , but on the contrary a mark of disgrace , a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill mannered dog . notoriety is often mistaken for fame . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox who had lost his tail . a fox caught in a trap escaped , but in so doing lost his tail . thereafter , feeling his life a burden from the shame and ridicule to which he was exposed , he schemed to convince all the other foxes that being tailless was much more attractive , thus making up for his own deprivation . he assembled a good many foxes and publicly advised them to cut off their tails , saying that they would not only look much better without them , but that they would get rid of the weight of the brush , which was a very great inconvenience . one of them interrupting him said , if you had not yourself lost your tail , my friend , you would not thus counsel us . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the boy and the nettles . a boy was stung by a nettle . he ran home and told his mother , saying , although it hurts me very much , i only touched it gently . that was just why it stung you , said his mother . the next time you touch a nettle , grasp it boldly , and it will be soft as silk to your hand , and not in the least hurt you . whatever you do , do with all your might . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the man and his two sweethearts . a middle - aged man , whose hair had begun to turn gray , courted two women at the same time . one of them was young , and the other well advanced in years . the elder woman , ashamed to be courted by a man younger than herself , made a point , whenever her admirer visited her , to pull out some portion of his black hairs . the younger , on the contrary , not wishing to become the wife of an old man , was equally zealous in removing every gray hair she could find . thus it came to pass that between them both he very soon found that he had not a hair left on his head . those who seek to please everybody please nobody . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the astronomer . an astronomer used to go out at night to observe the stars . one evening , as he wandered through the suburbs with his whole attention fixed on the sky , he fell accidentally into a deep well . while he lamented and bewailed his sores and bruises , and cried loudly for help , a neighbor ran to the well , and learning what had happened said : hark ye , old fellow , why , in striving to pry into what is in heaven , do you not manage to see what is on earth ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wolves and the sheep . why should there always be this fear and slaughter between us ? said the wolves to the sheep . those evil - disposed dogs have much to answer for . they always bark whenever we approach you and attack us before we have done any harm . if you would only dismiss them from your heels , there might soon be treaties of peace and reconciliation between us . the sheep , poor silly creatures , were easily beguiled and dismissed the dogs , whereupon the wolves destroyed the unguarded flock at their own pleasure . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the old woman and the physician . an old woman having lost the use of her eyes , called in a physician to heal them , and made this bargain with him in the presence of witnesses : that if he should cure her blindness , he should receive from her a sum of money ; but if her infirmity remained , she should give him nothing . this agreement being made , the physician , time after time , applied his salve to her eyes , and on every visit took something away , stealing all her property little by little . and when he had got all she had , he healed her and demanded the promised payment . the old woman , when she recovered her sight and saw none of her goods in her house , would give him nothing . the physician insisted on his claim , and , as she still refused , summoned her before the judge . the old woman , standing up in the court , argued : this man here speaks the truth in what he says ; for i did promise to give him a sum of money if i should recover my sight : but if i continued blind , i was to give him nothing . now he declares that i am healed . i on the contrary affirm that i am still blind ; for when i lost the use of my eyes , i saw in my house various chattels and valuable goods : but now , though he swears i am cured of my blindness , i am not able to see a single thing in it . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fighting cocks and the eagle . two game cocks were fiercely fighting for the mastery of the farmyard . one at last put the other to flight . the vanquished cock skulked away and hid himself in a quiet corner , while the conqueror , flying up to a high wall , flapped his wings and crowed exultingly with all his might . an eagle sailing through the air pounced upon him and carried him off in his talons . the vanquished cock immediately came out of his corner , and ruled henceforth with undisputed mastery . pride goes before destruction . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the charger and the miller . a charger , feeling the infirmities of age , was sent to work in a mill instead of going out to battle . but when he was compelled to grind instead of serving in the wars , he bewailed his change of fortune and called to mind his former state , saying , ah ! miller , i had indeed to go campaigning before , but i was barbed from counter to tail , and a man went along to groom me ; and now i cannot understand what ailed me to prefer the mill before the battle . forbear , said the miller to him , harping on what was of yore , for it is the common lot of mortals to sustain the ups and downs of fortune . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox and the monkey . a monkey once danced in an assembly of the beasts , and so pleased them all by his performance that they elected him their king . a fox , envying him the honor , discovered a piece of meat lying in a trap , and leading the monkey to the place where it was , said that she had found a store , but had not used it , she had kept it for him as treasure trove of his kingdom , and counseled him to lay hold of it . the monkey approached carelessly and was caught in the trap ; and on his accusing the fox of purposely leading him into the snare , she replied , o monkey , and are you , with such a mind as yours , going to be king over the beasts ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the horse and his rider . a horse soldier took the utmost pains with his charger . as long as the war lasted , he looked upon him as his fellow - helper in all emergencies and fed him carefully with hay and corn . but when the war was over , he only allowed him chaff to eat and made him carry heavy loads of wood , subjecting him to much slavish drudgery and ill - treatment . war was again proclaimed , however , and when the trumpet summoned him to his standard , the soldier put on his charger its military trappings , and mounted , being clad in his heavy coat of mail . the horse fell down straightway under the weight , no longer equal to the burden , and said to his master , you must now go to the war on foot , for you have transformed me from a horse into an ass ; and how can you expect that i can again turn in a moment from an ass to a horse ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the belly and the members . the members of the body rebelled against the belly , and said , why should we be perpetually engaged in administering to your wants , while you do nothing but take your rest , and enjoy yourself in luxury and self - indulgence ? the members carried out their resolve and refused their assistance to the belly . the whole body quickly became debilitated , and the hands , feet , mouth , and eyes , when too late , repented of their folly . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the vine and the goat . a vine was luxuriant in the time of vintage with leaves and grapes . a goat , passing by , nibbled its young tendrils and its leaves . the vine addressed him and said : why do you thus injure me without a cause , and crop my leaves ? is there no young grass left ? but i shall not have to wait long for my just revenge ; for if you now should crop my leaves , and cut me down to my root , i shall provide the wine to pour over you when you are led as a victim to the sacrifice . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | jupiter and the monkey . jupiter issued a proclamation to all the beasts of the forest and promised a royal reward to the one whose offspring should be deemed the handsomest . the monkey came with the rest and presented , with all a mother’s tenderness , a flat - nosed , hairless , ill - featured young monkey as a candidate for the promised reward . a general laugh saluted her on the presentation of her son . she resolutely said , i know not whether jupiter will allot the prize to my son , but this i do know , that he is at least in the eyes of me his mother , the dearest , handsomest , and most beautiful of all . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the widow and her little maidens . a widow who was fond of cleaning had two little maidens to wait on her . she was in the habit of waking them early in the morning , at cockcrow . the maidens , aggravated by such excessive labor , resolved to kill the cock who roused their mistress so early . when they had done this , they found that they had only prepared for themselves greater troubles , for their mistress , no longer hearing the hour from the cock , woke them up to their work in the middle of the night . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the shepherd’s boy and the wolf . a shepherd - boy , who watched a flock of sheep near a village , brought out the villagers three or four times by crying out , wolf ! wolf ! and when his neighbors came to help him , laughed at them for their pains . the wolf , however , did truly come at last . the shepherd - boy , now really alarmed , shouted in an agony of terror : pray , do come and help me ; the wolf is killing the sheep ; but no one paid any heed to his cries , nor rendered any assistance . the wolf , having no cause of fear , at his leisure lacerated or destroyed the whole flock . there is no believing a liar , even when he speaks the truth . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the cat and the birds . a cat , hearing that the birds in a certain aviary were ailing dressed himself up as a physician , and , taking his cane and a bag of instruments becoming his profession , went to call on them . he knocked at the door and inquired of the inmates how they all did , saying that if they were ill , he would be happy to prescribe for them and cure them . they replied , we are all very well , and shall continue so , if you will only be good enough to go away , and leave us as we are . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the kid and the wolf . a kid standing on the roof of a house , out of harm’s way , saw a wolf passing by and immediately began to taunt and revile him . the wolf , looking up , said , sirrah ! i hear thee : yet it is not thou who mockest me , but the roof on which thou art standing . time and place often give the advantage to the weak over the strong . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ox and the frog . an ox drinking at a pool trod on a brood of young frogs and crushed one of them to death . the mother coming up , and missing one of her sons , inquired of his brothers what had become of him . he is dead , dear mother ; for just now a very huge beast with four great feet came to the pool and crushed him to death with his cloven heel . the frog , puffing herself out , inquired , if the beast was as big as that in size . cease , mother , to puff yourself out , said her son , and do not be angry ; for you would , i assure you , sooner burst than successfully imitate the hugeness of that monster . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the shepherd and the wolf . a shepherd once found the whelp of a wolf and brought it up , and after a while taught it to steal lambs from the neighboring flocks . the wolf , having shown himself an apt pupil , said to the shepherd , since you have taught me to steal , you must keep a sharp lookout , or you will lose some of your own flock . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the father and his two daughters . a man had two daughters , the one married to a gardener , and the other to a tile - maker . after a time he went to the daughter who had married the gardener , and inquired how she was and how all things went with her . she said , all things are prospering with me , and i have only one wish , that there may be a heavy fall of rain , in order that the plants may be well watered . not long after , he went to the daughter who had married the tilemaker , and likewise inquired of her how she fared ; she replied , i want for nothing , and have only one wish , that the dry weather may continue , and the sun shine hot and bright , so that the bricks might be dried . he said to her , if your sister wishes for rain , and you for dry weather , with which of the two am i to join my wishes ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the farmer and his sons . a father , being on the point of death , wished to be sure that his sons would give the same attention to his farm as he himself had given it . he called them to his bedside and said , my sons , there is a great treasure hid in one of my vineyards . the sons , after his death , took their spades and mattocks and carefully dug over every portion of their land . they found no treasure , but the vines repaid their labor by an extraordinary and superabundant crop . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the crab and its mother . a crab said to her son , why do you walk so one - sided , my child ? it is far more becoming to go straight forward . the young crab replied : quite true , dear mother ; and if you will show me the straight way , i will promise to walk in it . the mother tried in vain , and submitted without remonstrance to the reproof of her child . example is more powerful than precept . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the heifer and the ox . a heifer saw an ox hard at work harnessed to a plow , and tormented him with reflections on his unhappy fate in being compelled to labor . shortly afterwards , at the harvest festival , the owner released the ox from his yoke , but bound the heifer with cords and led him away to the altar to be slain in honor of the occasion . the ox saw what was being done , and said with a smile to the heifer : for this you were allowed to live in idleness , because you were presently to be sacrificed . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the swallow , the serpent , and the court of justice . a swallow , returning from abroad and especially fond of dwelling with men , built herself a nest in the wall of a court of justice and there hatched seven young birds . a serpent gliding past the nest from its hole in the wall ate up the young unfledged nestlings . the swallow , finding her nest empty , lamented greatly and exclaimed : woe to me a stranger ! that in this place where all others’ rights are protected , i alone should suffer wrong . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the thief and his mother . a boy stole a lesson - book from one of his schoolfellows and took it home to his mother . she not only abstained from beating him , but encouraged him . he next time stole a cloak and brought it to her , and she again commended him . the youth , advanced to adulthood , proceeded to steal things of still greater value . at last he was caught in the very act , and having his hands bound behind him , was led away to the place of public execution . his mother followed in the crowd and violently beat her breast in sorrow , whereupon the young man said , i wish to say something to my mother in her ear . she came close to him , and he quickly seized her ear with his teeth and bit it off . the mother upbraided him as an unnatural child , whereon he replied , ah ! if you had beaten me when i first stole and brought to you that lesson - book , i should not have come to this , nor have been thus led to a disgraceful death . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the old man and death . an old man was employed in cutting wood in the forest , and , in carrying the faggots to the city for sale one day , became very wearied with his long journey . he sat down by the wayside , and throwing down his load , besought death to come . death immediately appeared in answer to his summons and asked for what reason he had called him . the old man hurriedly replied , that , lifting up the load , you may place it again upon my shoulders . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fir - tree and the bramble . a fir - tree said boastingly to the bramble , you are useful for nothing at all ; while i am everywhere used for roofs and houses . the bramble answered : you poor creature , if you would only call to mind the axes and saws which are about to hew you down , you would have reason to wish that you had grown up a bramble , not a fir - tree . better poverty without care , than riches with . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the mouse , the frog , and the hawk . a mouse who always lived on the land , by an unlucky chance formed an intimate acquaintance with a frog , who lived for the most part in the water . the frog , one day intent on mischief , bound the foot of the mouse tightly to his own . thus joined together , the frog first of all led his friend the mouse to the meadow where they were accustomed to find their food . after this , he gradually led him towards the pool in which he lived , until reaching the very brink , he suddenly jumped in , dragging the mouse with him . the frog enjoyed the water amazingly , and swam croaking about , as if he had done a good deed . the unhappy mouse was soon suffocated by the water , and his dead body floated about on the surface , tied to the foot of the frog . a hawk observed it , and , pouncing upon it with his talons , carried it aloft . the frog , being still fastened to the leg of the mouse , was also carried off a prisoner , and was eaten by the hawk . harm hatch , harm catch . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the man bitten by a dog . a man who had been bitten by a dog went about in quest of someone who might heal him . a friend , meeting him and learning what he wanted , said , if you would be cured , take a piece of bread , and dip it in the blood from your wound , and go and give it to the dog that bit you . the man who had been bitten laughed at this advice and said , why ? if i should do so , it would be as if i should beg every dog in the town to bite me . benefits bestowed upon the evil - disposed increase their means of injuring you . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the two pots . a river carried down in its stream two pots , one made of earthenware and the other of brass . the earthen pot said to the brass pot , pray keep at a distance and do not come near me , for if you touch me ever so slightly , i shall be broken in pieces , and besides , i by no means wish to come near you . equals make the best friends . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wolf and the sheep . a wolf , sorely wounded and bitten by dogs , lay sick and maimed in his lair . being in want of food , he called to a sheep who was passing , and asked him to fetch some water from a stream flowing close beside him . for , he said , if you will bring me drink , i will find means to provide myself with meat . yes , said the sheep , if i should bring you the draught , you would doubtless make me provide the meat also . hypocritical speeches are easily seen through . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the aethiop . the purchaser of a black servant was persuaded that the color of his skin arose from dirt contracted through the neglect of his former masters . on bringing him home he resorted to every means of cleaning , and subjected the man to incessant scrubbings . the servant caught a severe cold , but he never changed his color or complexion . what’s bred in the bone will stick to the flesh . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fisherman and his nets . a fisherman , engaged in his calling , made a very successful cast and captured a great haul of fish . he managed by a skillful handling of his net to

| the huntsman and the fisherman . a huntsman , returning with his dogs from the field , fell in by chance with a fisherman who was bringing home a basket well laden with fish . the huntsman wished to have the fish , and their owner experienced an equal longing for the contents of the game - bag . they quickly agreed to exchange the produce of their day’s sport . each was so well pleased with his bargain that they made for some time the same exchange day after day . finally a neighbor said to them , if you go on in this way , you will soon destroy by frequent use the pleasure of your exchange , and each will again wish to retain the fruits of his own sport . abstain and enjoy . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the old woman and the wine - jar . an old woman found an empty jar which had lately been full of prime old wine and which still retained the fragrant smell of its former contents . she greedily placed it several times to her nose , and drawing it backwards and forwards said , o most delicious ! how nice must the wine itself have been , when it leaves behind in the very vessel which contained it so sweet a perfume ! . the memory of a good deed lives . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox and the crow . a crow having stolen a bit of meat , perched in a tree and held it in her beak . a fox , seeing this , longed to possess the meat himself , and by a wily stratagem succeeded . how handsome is the crow , he exclaimed , in the beauty of her shape and in the fairness of her complexion ! oh , if her voice were only equal to her beauty , she would deservedly be considered the queen of birds ! this he said deceitfully ; but the crow , anxious to refute the reflection cast upon her voice , set up a loud caw and dropped the flesh . the fox quickly picked it up , and thus addressed the crow : my good crow , your voice is right enough , but your wit is wanting . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the two dogs . a man had two dogs : a hound , trained to assist him in his sports , and a housedog , taught to watch the house . when he returned home after a good day’s sport , he always gave the housedog a large share of his spoil . the hound , feeling much aggrieved at this , reproached his companion , saying , it is very hard to have all this labor , while you , who do not assist in the chase , luxuriate on the fruits of my exertions . the housedog replied , do not blame me , my friend , but find fault with the master , who has not taught me to labor , but to depend for subsistence on the labor of others . children are not to be blamed for the faults of their parents . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the stag in the ox - stall . a stag , roundly chased by the hounds and blinded by fear to the danger he was running into , took shelter in a farmyard and hid himself in a shed among the oxen . an ox gave him this kindly warning : o unhappy creature ! why should you thus , of your own accord , incur destruction and trust yourself in the house of your enemy ? the stag replied : only allow me , friend , to stay where i am , and i will undertake to find some favorable opportunity of effecting my escape . at the approach of the evening the herdsman came to feed his cattle , but did not see the stag ; and even the farm - bailiff with several laborers passed through the shed and failed to notice him . the stag , congratulating himself on his safety , began to express his sincere thanks to the oxen who had kindly helped him in the hour of need . one of them again answered him : we indeed wish you well , but the danger is not over . there is one other yet to pass through the shed , who has as it were a hundred eyes , and until he has come and gone , your life is still in peril . at that moment the master himself entered , and having had to complain that his oxen had not been properly fed , he went up to their racks and cried out : why is there such a scarcity of fodder ? there is not half enough straw for them to lie on . those lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away . while he thus examined everything in turn , he spied the tips of the antlers of the stag peeping out of the straw . then summoning his laborers , he ordered that the stag should be seized and killed . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the hawk , the kite , and the pigeons . the pigeons , terrified by the appearance of a kite , called upon the hawk to defend them . he at once consented . when they had admitted him into the cote , they found that he made more havoc and slew a larger number of them in one day than the kite could pounce upon in a whole year . avoid a remedy that is worse than the disease . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the widow and the sheep . a certain poor widow had one solitary sheep . at shearing time , wishing to take his fleece and to avoid expense , she sheared him herself , but used the shears so unskillfully that with the fleece she sheared the flesh . the sheep , writhing with pain , said , why do you hurt me so , mistress ? what weight can my blood add to the wool ? if you want my flesh , there is the butcher , who will kill me in an instant ; but if you want my fleece and wool , there is the shearer , who will shear and not hurt me . the least outlay is not always the greatest gain . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wild ass and the lion . a wild ass and a lion entered into an alliance so that they might capture the beasts of the forest with greater ease . the lion agreed to assist the wild ass with his strength , while the wild ass gave the lion the benefit of his greater speed . when they had taken as many beasts as their necessities required , the lion undertook to distribute the prey , and for this purpose divided it into three shares . i will take the first share , he said , because i am king : and the second share , as a partner with you in the chase : and the third share ( believe me ) will be a source of great evil to you , unless you willingly resign it to me , and set off as fast as you can . might makes right . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the eagle and the arrow . an eagle sat on a lofty rock , watching the movements of a hare whom he sought to make his prey . an archer , who saw the eagle from a place of concealment , took an accurate aim and wounded him mortally . the eagle gave one look at the arrow that had entered his heart and saw in that single glance that its feathers had been furnished by himself . it is a double grief to me , he exclaimed , that i should perish by an arrow feathered from my own wings . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the sick kite . a kite , sick unto death , said to his mother : o mother ! do not mourn , but at once invoke the gods that my life may be prolonged . she replied , alas ! my son , which of the gods do you think will pity you ? is there one whom you have not outraged by filching from their very altars a part of the sacrifice offered up to them ? . we must make friends in prosperity if we would have their help in adversity . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lion and the dolphin . a lion roaming by the seashore saw a dolphin lift up its head out of the waves , and suggested that they contract an alliance , saying that of all the animals they ought to be the best friends , since the one was the king of beasts on the earth , and the other was the sovereign ruler of all the inhabitants of the ocean . the dolphin gladly consented to this request . not long afterwards the lion had a combat with a wild bull , and called on the dolphin to help him . the dolphin , though quite willing to give him assistance , was unable to do so , as he could not by any means reach the land . the lion abused him as a traitor . the dolphin replied , nay , my friend , blame not me , but nature , which , while giving me the sovereignty of the sea , has quite denied me the power of living upon the land . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lion and the boar . on a summer day , when the great heat induced a general thirst among the beasts , a lion and a boar came at the same moment to a small well to drink . they fiercely disputed which of them should drink first , and were soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal combat . when they stopped suddenly to catch their breath for a fiercer renewal of the fight , they saw some vultures waiting in the distance to feast on the one that should fall first . they at once made up their quarrel , saying , it is better for us to make friends , than to become the food of crows or vultures . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the one - eyed doe . a doe blind in one eye was accustomed to graze as near to the edge of the cliff as she possibly could , in the hope of securing her greater safety . she turned her sound eye towards the land that she might get the earliest tidings of the approach of hunter or hound , and her injured eye towards the sea , from whence she entertained no anticipation of danger . some boatmen sailing by saw her , and taking a successful aim , mortally wounded her . yielding up her last breath , she gasped forth this lament : o wretched creature that i am ! to take such precaution against the land , and after all to find this seashore , to which i had come for safety , so much more perilous . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the shepherd and the sea . a shepherd , keeping watch over his sheep near the shore , saw the sea very calm and smooth , and longed to make a voyage with a view to commerce . he sold all his flock , invested it in a cargo of dates , and set sail . but a very great tempest came on , and the ship being in danger of sinking , he threw all his merchandise overboard , and barely escaped with his life in the empty ship . not long afterwards when someone passed by and observed the unruffled calm of the sea , he interrupted him and said , it is again in want of dates , and therefore looks quiet . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass , the cock , and the lion . an ass and a cock were in a straw - yard together when a lion , desperate from hunger , approached the spot . he was about to spring upon the ass , when the cock ( to the sound of whose voice the lion , it is said , has a singular aversion ) crowed loudly , and the lion fled away as fast as he could . the ass , observing his trepidation at the mere crowing of a cock summoned courage to attack him , and galloped after him for that purpose . he had run no long distance , when the lion , turning about , seized him and tore him to pieces . false confidence often leads into danger . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the mice and the weasels . the weasels and the mice waged a perpetual war with each other , in which much blood was shed . the weasels were always the victors . the mice thought that the cause of their frequent defeats was that they had no leaders set apart from the general army to command them , and that they were exposed to dangers from lack of discipline . they therefore chose as leaders mice that were most renowned for their family descent , strength , and counsel , as well as those most noted for their courage in the fight , so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and formed into troops , regiments , and battalions . when all this was done , and the army disciplined , and the herald mouse had duly proclaimed war by challenging the weasels , the newly chosen generals bound their heads with straws , that they might be more conspicuous to all their troops . scarcely had the battle begun , when a great rout overwhelmed the mice , who scampered off as fast as they could to their holes . the generals , not being able to get in on account of the ornaments on their heads , were all captured and eaten by the weasels . the more honor the more danger . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the mice in council . the mice summoned a council to decide how they might best devise means of warning themselves of the approach of their great enemy the cat . among the many plans suggested , the one that found most favor was the proposal to tie a bell to the neck of the cat , so that the mice , being warned by the sound of the tinkling , might run away and hide themselves in their holes at his approach . but when the mice further debated who among them should thus bell the cat , there was no one found to do it . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wolf and the housedog . a wolf , meeting a big well - fed mastiff with a wooden collar about his neck asked him who it was that fed him so well and yet compelled him to drag that heavy log about wherever he went . the master , he replied . then said the wolf : may no friend of mine ever be in such a plight ; for the weight of this chain is enough to spoil the appetite . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the rivers and the sea . the rivers joined together to complain to the sea , saying , why is it that when we flow into your tides so potable and sweet , you work in us such a change , and make us salty and unfit to drink ? the sea , perceiving that they intended to throw the blame on him , said , pray cease to flow into me , and then you will not be made briny . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the playful ass . an ass climbed up to the roof of a building , and frisking about there , broke in the tiling . the owner went up after him and quickly drove him down , beating him severely with a thick wooden cudgel . the ass said , why , i saw the monkey do this very thing yesterday , and you all laughed heartily , as if it afforded you very great amusement . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the three tradesmen . a great city was besieged , and its inhabitants were called together to consider the best means of protecting it from the enemy . a bricklayer earnestly recommended bricks as affording the best material for an effective resistance . a carpenter , with equal enthusiasm , proposed timber as a preferable method of defense . upon which a currier stood up and said , sirs , i differ from you altogether : there is no material for resistance equal to a covering of hides ; and nothing so good as leather . every man for himself . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the master and his dogs . a certain man , detained by a storm in his country house , first of all killed his sheep , and then his goats , for the maintenance of his household . the storm still continuing , he was obliged to slaughter his yoke oxen for food . on seeing this , his dogs took counsel together , and said , it is time for us to be off , for if the master spare not his oxen , who work for his gain , how can we expect him to spare us ? . he is not to be trusted as a friend who mistreats his own family . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wolf and the shepherds . a wolf , passing by , saw some shepherds in a hut eating a haunch of mutton for their dinner . approaching them , he said , what a clamor you would raise if i were to do as you are doing ! | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the dolphins , the whales , and the sprat . the dolphins and whales waged a fierce war with each other . when the battle was at its height , a sprat lifted its head out of the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if they would accept him as an umpire . one of the dolphins replied , we would far rather be destroyed in our battle with each other than admit any interference from you in our affairs . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass carrying the image . an ass once carried through the streets of a city a famous wooden image , to be placed in one of its temples . as he passed along , the crowd made lowly prostration before the image . the ass , thinking that they bowed their heads in token of respect for himself , bristled up with pride , gave himself airs , and refused to move another step . the driver , seeing him thus stop , laid his whip lustily about his shoulders and said , o you perverse dull - head ! it is not yet come to this , that men pay worship to an ass . they are not wise who give to themselves the credit due to others . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the two travelers and the axe . two men were journeying together . one of them picked up an axe that lay upon the path , and said , i have found an axe . nay , my friend , . replied the other , do not say ‘i , ’ but ‘we’ have found an axe . they had not gone far before they saw the owner of the axe pursuing them , and he who had picked up the axe said , we are undone . nay , replied the other , keep to your first mode of speech , my friend ; what you thought right then , think right now . say ‘i , ’ not ‘we’ are undone . he who shares the danger ought to share the prize . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the old lion . a lion , worn out with years and powerless from disease , lay on the ground at the point of death . a boar rushed upon him , and avenged with a stroke of his tusks a long - remembered injury . shortly afterwards the bull with his horns gored him as if he were an enemy . when the ass saw that the huge beast could be assailed with impunity , he let drive at his forehead with his heels . the expiring lion said , i have reluctantly brooked the insults of the brave , but to be compelled to endure such treatment from thee , a disgrace to nature , is indeed to die a double death . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the old hound . a hound , who in the days of his youth and strength had never yielded to any beast of the forest , encountered in his old age a boar in the chase . he seized him boldly by the ear , but could not retain his hold because of the decay of his teeth , so that the boar escaped . his master , quickly coming up , was very much disappointed , and fiercely abused the dog . the hound looked up and said , it was not my fault master : my spirit was as good as ever , but i could not help my infirmities . i rather deserve to be praised for what i have been , than to be blamed for what i am . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the bee and jupiter . a bee from mount hymettus , the queen of the hive , ascended to olympus to present jupiter some honey fresh from her combs . jupiter , delighted with the offering of honey , promised to give whatever she should ask . she therefore besought him , saying , give me , i pray thee , a sting , that if any mortal shall approach to take my honey , i may kill him . jupiter was much displeased , for he loved the race of man , but could not refuse the request because of his promise . he thus answered the bee : you shall have your request , but it will be at the peril of your own life . for if you use your sting , it shall remain in the wound you make , and then you will die from the loss of it . evil wishes , like chickens , come home to roost . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the milk - woman and her pail . a farmer’s daughter was carrying her pail of milk from the field to the farmhouse , when she fell a - musing . the money for which this milk will be sold , will buy at least three hundred eggs . the eggs , allowing for all mishaps , will produce two hundred and fifty chickens . the chickens will become ready for the market when poultry will fetch the highest price , so that by the end of the year i shall have money enough from my share to buy a new gown . in this dress i will go to the christmas parties , where all the young fellows will propose to me , but i will toss my head and refuse them every one . at this moment she tossed her head in unison with her thoughts , when down fell the milk pail to the ground , and all her imaginary schemes perished in a moment . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the seaside travelers . some travelers , journeying along the seashore , climbed to the summit of a tall cliff , and looking over the sea , saw in the distance what they thought was a large ship . they waited in the hope of seeing it enter the harbor , but as the object on which they looked was driven nearer to shore by the wind , they found that it could at the most be a small boat , and not a ship . when however it reached the beach , they discovered that it was only a large faggot of sticks , and one of them said to his companions , we have waited for no purpose , for after all there is nothing to see but a load of wood . our mere anticipations of life outrun its realities . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the brazier and his dog . a brazier had a little dog , which was a great favorite with his master , and his constant companion . while he hammered away at his metals the dog slept ; but when , on the other hand , he went to dinner and began to eat , the dog woke up and wagged his tail , as if he would ask for a share of his meal . his master one day , pretending to be angry and shaking his stick at him , said , you wretched little sluggard ! what shall i do to you ? while i am hammering on the anvil , you sleep on the mat ; and when i begin to eat after my toil , you wake up and wag your tail for food . do you not know that labor is the source of every blessing , and that none but those who work are entitled to eat ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass and his shadow . a traveler hired an ass to convey him to a distant place . the day being intensely hot , and the sun shining in its strength , the traveler stopped to rest , and sought shelter from the heat under the shadow of the ass . as this afforded only protection for one , and as the traveler and the owner of the ass both claimed it , a violent dispute arose between them as to which of them had the right to the shadow . the owner maintained that he had let the ass only , and not his shadow . the traveler asserted that he had , with the hire of the ass , hired his shadow also . the quarrel proceeded from words to blows , and while the men fought , the ass galloped off . in quarreling about the shadow we often lose the substance . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass and his masters . an ass , belonging to an herb - seller who gave him too little food and too much work made a petition to jupiter to be released from his present service and provided with another master . jupiter , after warning him that he would repent his request , caused him to be sold to a tile - maker . shortly afterwards , finding that he had heavier loads to carry and harder work in the brick - field , he petitioned for another change of master . jupiter , telling him that it would be the last time that he could grant his request , ordained that he be sold to a tanner . the ass found that he had fallen into worse hands , and noting his master’s occupation , said , groaning : it would have been better for me to have been either starved by the one , or to have been overworked by the other of my former masters , than to have been bought by my present owner , who will even after i am dead tan my hide , and make me useful to him . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the oak and the reeds . a very large oak was uprooted by the wind and thrown across a stream . it fell among some reeds , which it thus addressed : i wonder how you , who are so light and weak , are not entirely crushed by these strong winds . they replied , you fight and contend with the wind , and consequently you are destroyed ; while we on the contrary bend before the least breath of air , and therefore remain unbroken , and escape . stoop to conquer . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fisherman and the little fish . a fisherman who lived on the produce of his nets , one day caught a single small fish as the result of his day’s labor . the fish , panting convulsively , thus entreated for his life : o sir , what good can i be to you , and how little am i worth ? i am not yet come to my full size . pray spare my life , and put me back into the sea . i shall soon become a large fish fit for the tables of the rich , and then you can catch me again , and make a handsome profit of me . the fisherman replied , i should indeed be a very simple fellow if , for the chance of a greater uncertain profit , i were to forego my present certain gain . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the hunter and the woodman . a hunter , not very bold , was searching for the tracks of a lion . he asked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen any marks of his footsteps or knew where his lair was . i will , said the man , at once show you the lion himself . the hunter , turning very pale and chattering with his teeth from fear , replied , no , thank you . i did not ask that ; it is his track only i am in search of , not the lion himself . the hero is brave in deeds as well as words . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wild boar and the fox . a wild boar stood under a tree and rubbed his tusks against the trunk . a fox passing by asked him why he thus sharpened his teeth when there was no danger threatening from either huntsman or hound . he replied , i do it advisedly ; for it would never do to have to sharpen my weapons just at the time i ought to be using them . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lion in a farmyard . a lion entered a farmyard . the farmer , wishing to catch him , shut the gate . when the lion found that he could not escape , he flew upon the sheep and killed them , and then attacked the oxen . the farmer , beginning to be alarmed for his own safety , opened the gate and released the lion . on his departure the farmer grievously lamented the destruction of his sheep and oxen , but his wife , who had been a spectator to all that took place , said , on my word , you are rightly served , for how could you for a moment think of shutting up a lion along with you in your farmyard when you know that you shake in your shoes if you only hear his roar at a distance ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | mercury and the sculptor . mercury once determined to learn in what esteem he was held among mortals . for this purpose he assumed the character of a man and visited in this disguise a sculptor’s studio having looked at various statues , he demanded the price of two figures of jupiter and juno . when the sum at which they were valued was named , he pointed to a figure of himself , saying to the sculptor , you will certainly want much more for this , as it is the statue of the messenger of the gods , and author of all your gain . the sculptor replied , well , if you will buy these , i’ll fling you that into the bargain . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the swan and the goose . a certain rich man bought in the market a goose and a swan . he fed the one for his table and kept the other for the sake of its song . when the time came for killing the goose , the cook went to get him at night , when it was dark , and he was not able to distinguish one bird from the other . by mistake he caught the swan instead of the goose . the swan , threatened with death , burst forth into song and thus made himself known by his voice , and preserved his life by his melody . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the swollen fox . a very hungry fox , seeing some bread and meat left by shepherds in the hollow of an oak , crept into the hole and made a hearty meal . when he finished , he was so full that he was not able to get out , and began to groan and lament his fate . another fox passing by heard his cries , and coming up , inquired the cause of his complaining . on learning what had happened , he said to him , ah , you will have to remain there , my friend , until you become such as you were when you crept in , and then you will easily get out . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox and the woodcutter . a fox , running before the hounds , came across a woodcutter felling an oak and begged him to show him a safe hiding - place . the woodcutter advised him to take shelter in his own hut , so the fox crept in and hid himself in a corner . the huntsman soon came up with his hounds and inquired of the woodcutter if he had seen the fox . he declared that he had not seen him , and yet pointed , all the time he was speaking , to the hut where the fox lay hidden . the huntsman took no notice of the signs , but believing his word , hastened forward in the chase . as soon as they were well away , the fox departed without taking any notice of the woodcutter : whereon he called to him and reproached him , saying , you ungrateful fellow , you owe your life to me , and yet you leave me without a word of thanks . the fox replied , indeed , i should have thanked you fervently if your deeds had been as good as your words , and if your hands had not been traitors to your speech . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the birdcatcher , the partridge , and the cock . a birdcatcher was about to sit down to a dinner of herbs when a friend unexpectedly came in . the bird - trap was quite empty , as he had caught nothing , and he had to kill a pied partridge , which he had tamed for a decoy . the bird entreated earnestly for his life : what would you do without me when next you spread your nets ? who would chirp you to sleep , or call for you the covey of answering birds ? the birdcatcher spared his life , and determined to pick out a fine young cock just attaining to his comb . but the cock expostulated in piteous tones from his perch : if you kill me , who will announce to you the appearance of the dawn ? who will wake you to your daily tasks or tell you when it is time to visit the bird - trap in the morning ? he replied , what you say is true . you are a capital bird at telling the time of day . but my friend and i must have our dinners . necessity knows no law . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the monkey and the fishermen . a monkey perched upon a lofty tree saw some fishermen casting their nets into a river , and narrowly watched their proceedings . the fishermen after a while gave up fishing , and on going home to dinner left their nets upon the bank . the monkey , who is the most imitative of animals , descended from the treetop and endeavored to do as they had done . having handled the net , he threw it into the river , but became tangled in the meshes and drowned . with his last breath he said to himself , i am rightly served ; for what business had i who had never handled a net to try and catch fish ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the flea and the wrestler . a flea settled upon the bare foot of a wrestler and bit him , causing the man to call loudly upon hercules for help . when the flea a second time hopped upon his foot , he groaned and said , o hercules ! if you will not help me against a flea , how can i hope for your assistance against greater antagonists ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the two frogs . two frogs dwelt in the same pool . when the pool dried up under the summer’s heat , they left it and set out together for another home . as they went along they chanced to pass a deep well , amply supplied with water , and when they saw it , one of the frogs said to the other , let us descend and make our abode in this well : it will furnish us with shelter and food . the other replied with greater caution , but suppose the water should fail us . how can we get out again from so great a depth ? . do nothing without a regard to the consequences . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the cat and the mice . a certain house was overrun with mice . a cat , discovering this , made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one . fearing for their lives , the mice kept themselves close in their holes . the cat was no longer able to get at them and perceived that she must tempt them forth by some device . for this purpose she jumped upon a peg , and suspending herself from it , pretended to be dead . one of the mice , peeping stealthily out , saw her and said , ah , my good madam , even though you should turn into a meal - bag , we will not come near you . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lion , the bear , and the fox . a lion and a bear seized a kid at the same moment , and fought fiercely for its possession . when they had fearfully lacerated each other and were faint from the long combat , they lay down exhausted with fatigue . a fox , who had gone round them at a distance several times , saw them both stretched on the ground with the kid lying untouched in the middle . he ran in between them , and seizing the kid scampered off as fast as he could . the lion and the bear saw him , but not being able to get up , said , woe be to us , that we should have fought and belabored ourselves only to serve the turn of a fox . it sometimes happens that one man has all the toil , and another all the profit . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the doe and the lion . a doe hard pressed by hunters sought refuge in a cave belonging to a lion . the lion concealed himself on seeing her approach , but when she was safe within the cave , sprang upon her and tore her to pieces . woe is me , exclaimed the doe , who have escaped from man , only to throw myself into the mouth of a wild beast ? . in avoiding one evil , care must be taken not to fall into another . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the farmer and the fox . a farmer , who bore a grudge against a fox for robbing his poultry yard , caught him at last , and being determined to take an ample revenge , tied some rope well soaked in oil to his tail , and set it on fire . the fox by a strange fatality rushed to the fields of the farmer who had captured him . it was the time of the wheat harvest ; but the farmer reaped nothing that year and returned home grieving sorely . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the seagull and the kite . a seagull having bolted down too large a fish , burst its deep gullet - bag and lay down on the shore to die . a kite saw him and exclaimed : you richly deserve your fate ; for a bird of the air has no business to seek its food from the sea . every man should be content to mind his own business . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the philosopher , the ants , and mercury . a philosopher witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a vessel , of which the crew and passengers were all drowned . he inveighed against the injustice of providence , which would for the sake of one criminal perchance sailing in the ship allow so many innocent persons to perish . as he was indulging in these reflections , he found himself surrounded by a whole army of ants , near whose nest he was standing . one of them climbed up and stung him , and he immediately trampled them all to death with his foot . mercury presented himself , and striking the philosopher with his wand , said , and are you indeed to make yourself a judge of the dealings of providence , who hast thyself in a similar manner treated these poor ants ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the mouse and the bull . a bull was bitten by a mouse and , angered by the wound , tried to capture him . but the mouse reached his hole in safety . though the bull dug into the walls with his horns , he tired before he could rout out the mouse , and crouching down , went to sleep outside the hole . the mouse peeped out , crept furtively up his flank , and again biting him , retreated to his hole . the bull rising up , and not knowing what to do , was sadly perplexed . at which the mouse said , the great do not always prevail . there are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do mischief . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lion and the hare . a lion came across a hare , who was fast asleep . he was just in the act of seizing her , when a fine young hart trotted by , and he left the hare to follow him . the hare , scared by the noise , awoke and scudded away . the lion was unable after a long chase to catch the hart , and returned to feed upon the hare . on finding that the hare also had run off , he said , i am rightly served , for having let go of the food that i had in my hand for the chance of obtaining more . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the peasant and the eagle . a peasant found an eagle captured in a trap , and much admiring the bird , set him free . the eagle did not prove ungrateful to his deliverer , for seeing the peasant sitting under a wall which was not safe , he flew toward him and with his talons snatched a bundle from his head . when the peasant rose in pursuit , the eagle let the bundle fall again . taking it up , the man returned to the same place , to find that the wall under which he had been sitting had fallen to pieces ; and he marveled at the service rendered him by the eagle . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the image of mercury and the carpenter . a very poor man , a carpenter by trade , had a wooden image of mercury , before which he made offerings day by day , and begged the idol to make him rich , but in spite of his entreaties he became poorer and poorer . at last , being very angry , he took his image down from its pedestal and dashed it against the wall . when its head was knocked off , out came a stream of gold , which the carpenter quickly picked up and said , well , i think thou art altogether contradictory and unreasonable ; for when i paid you honor , i reaped no benefits : but now that i maltreat you i am loaded with an abundance of riches . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the bull and the goat . a bull , escaping from a lion , hid in a cave which some shepherds had recently occupied . as soon as he entered , a he - goat left in the cave sharply attacked him with his horns . the bull quietly addressed him : butt away as much as you will . i have no fear of you , but of the lion . let that monster go away and i will soon let you know what is the respective strength of a goat and a bull . it shows an evil disposition to take advantage of a friend in distress . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the dancing monkeys . a prince had some monkeys trained to dance . being naturally great mimics of men’s actions , they showed themselves most apt pupils , and when arrayed in their rich clothes and masks , they danced as well as any of the courtiers . the spectacle was often repeated with great applause , till on one occasion a courtier , bent on mischief , took from his pocket a handful of nuts and threw them upon the stage . the monkeys at the sight of the nuts forgot their dancing and became ( as indeed they were ) monkeys instead of actors . pulling off their masks and tearing their robes , they fought with one another for the nuts . the dancing spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox and the leopard . the fox and the leopard disputed which was the more beautiful of the two . the leopard exhibited one by one the various spots which decorated his skin . but the fox , interrupting him , said , and how much more beautiful than you am i , who am decorated , not in body , but in mind . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the monkeys and their mother . the monkey , it is said , has two young ones at each birth . the mother fondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection and care , but hates and neglects the other . it happened once that the young one which was caressed and loved was smothered by the too great affection of the mother , while the despised one was nurtured and reared in spite of the neglect to which it was exposed . the best intentions will not always ensure success . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the oaks and jupiter . the oaks presented a complaint to jupiter , saying , we bear for no purpose the burden of life , as of all the trees that grow we are the most continually in peril of the axe . jupiter made answer : you have only to thank yourselves for the misfortunes to which you are exposed : for if you did not make such excellent pillars and posts , and prove yourselves so serviceable to the carpenters and the farmers , the axe would not so frequently be laid to your roots . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the hare and the hound . a hound started a hare from his lair , but after a long run , gave up the chase . a goat - herd seeing him stop , mocked him , saying the little one is the best runner of the two . the hound replied , you do not see the difference between us : i was only running for a dinner , but he for his life . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the traveler and fortune . a traveler wearied from a long journey lay down , overcome with fatigue , on the very brink of a deep well . just as he was about to fall into the water , dame fortune , it is said , appeared to him and waking him from his slumber thus addressed him : good sir , pray wake up : for if you fall into the well , the blame will be thrown on me , and i shall get an ill name among mortals ; for i find that men are sure to impute their calamities to me , however much by their own folly they have really brought them on themselves . everyone is more or less master of his own fate . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the bald knight . a bald knight , who wore a wig , went out to hunt . a sudden puff of wind blew off his hat and wig , at which a loud laugh rang forth from his companions . he pulled up his horse , and with great glee joined in the joke by saying , what a marvel it is that hairs which are not mine should fly from me , when they have forsaken even the man on whose head they grew . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the shepherd and the dog . a shepherd penning his sheep in the fold for the night was about to shut up a wolf with them , when his dog perceiving the wolf said , master , how can you expect the sheep to be safe if you admit a wolf into the fold ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lamp . a lamp , soaked with too much oil and flaring brightly , boasted that it gave more light than the sun . then a sudden puff of wind arose , and the lamp was immediately extinguished . its owner lit it again , and said : boast no more , but henceforth be content to give thy light in silence . know that not even the stars need to be relit . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lion , the fox , and the ass . the lion , the fox and the ass entered into an agreement to assist each other in the chase . having secured a large booty , the lion on their return from the forest asked the ass to allot his due portion to each of the three partners in the treaty . the ass carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly requested the two others to make the first choice . the lion , bursting out into a great rage , devoured the ass . then he requested the fox to do him the favor to make a division . the fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and left to himself the smallest possible morsel . the lion said , who has taught you , my very excellent fellow , the art of division ? you are perfect to a fraction . he replied , i learned it from the ass , by witnessing his fate . happy is the man who learns from the misfortunes of others . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the bull , the lioness , and the wild - boar hunter . a bull finding a lion’s cub asleep gored him to death with his horns . the lioness came up , and bitterly lamented the death of her whelp . a wild - boar hunter , seeing her distress , stood at a distance and said to her , think how many men there are who have reason to lament the loss of their children , whose deaths have been caused by you . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the oak and the woodcutters . the woodcutter cut down a mountain oak and split it in pieces , making wedges of its own branches for dividing the trunk . the oak said with a sigh , i do not care about the blows of the axe aimed at my roots , but i do grieve at being torn in pieces by these wedges made from my own branches . misfortunes springing from ourselves are the hardest to bear . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the hen and the golden eggs . a cottager and his wife had a hen that laid a golden egg every day . they supposed that the hen must contain a great lump of gold in its inside , and in order to get the gold they killed it . having done so , they found to their surprise that the hen differed in no respect from their other hens . the foolish pair , thus hoping to become rich all at once , deprived themselves of the gain of which they were assured day by day . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass and the frogs . an ass , carrying a load of wood , passed through a pond . as he was crossing through the water he lost his footing , stumbled and fell , and not being able to rise on account of his load , groaned heavily . some frogs frequenting the pool heard his lamentation , and said , what would you do if you had to live here always as we do , when you make such a fuss about a mere fall into the water ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | men often bear little grievances with less courage than they do large misfortunes . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the crow and the raven . a crow was jealous of the raven , because he was considered a bird of good omen and always attracted the attention of men , who noted by his flight the good or evil course of future events . seeing some travelers approaching , the crow flew up into a tree , and perching herself on one of the branches , cawed as loudly as she could . the travelers turned towards the sound and wondered what it foreboded , when one of them said to his companion , let us proceed on our journey , my friend , for it is only the caw of a crow , and her cry , you know , is no omen . those who assume a character which does not belong to them , only make themselves ridiculous . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the trees and the axe . a man came into a forest and asked the trees to provide him a handle for his axe . the trees consented to his request and gave him a young ash - tree . no sooner had the man fitted a new handle to his axe from it , than he began to use it and quickly felled with his strokes the noblest giants of the forest . an old oak , lamenting when too late the destruction of his companions , said to a neighboring cedar , the first step has lost us all . if we had not given up the rights of the ash , we might yet have retained our own privileges and have stood for ages . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the crab and the fox . a crab , forsaking the seashore , chose a neighboring green meadow as its feeding ground . a fox came across him , and being very hungry ate him up . just as he was on the point of being eaten , the crab said , i well deserve my fate , for what business had i on the land , when by my nature and habits i am only adapted for the sea ? . contentment with our lot is an element of happiness . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the woman and her hen . a woman possessed a hen that gave her an egg every day . she often pondered how she might obtain two eggs daily instead of one , and at last , to gain her purpose , determined to give the hen a double allowance of barley . from that day the hen became fat and sleek , and never once laid another egg . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass and the old shepherd . a shepherd , watching his ass feeding in a meadow , was alarmed all of a sudden by the cries of the enemy . he appealed to the ass to fly with him , lest they should both be captured , but the animal lazily replied , why should i , pray ? do you think it likely the conqueror will place on me two sets of panniers ? no , rejoined the shepherd . then , said the ass , as long as i carry the panniers , what matters it to me whom i serve ? . in a change of government the poor change nothing beyond the name of their master . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the kites and the swans . tee kites of olden times , as well as the swans , had the privilege of song . but having heard the neigh of the horse , they were so enchanted with the sound , that they tried to imitate it ; and , in trying to neigh , they forgot how to sing . the desire for imaginary benefits often involves the loss of present blessings . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wolves and the sheepdogs . the wolves thus addressed the sheepdogs : why should you , who are like us in so many things , not be entirely of one mind with us , and live with us as brothers should ? we differ from you in one point only . we live in freedom , but you bow down to and slave for men , who in return for your services flog you with whips and put collars on your necks . they make you also guard their sheep , and while they eat the mutton throw only the bones to you . if you will be persuaded by us , you will give us the sheep , and we will enjoy them in common , till we all are surfeited . the dogs listened favorably to these proposals , and , entering the den of the wolves , they were set upon and torn to pieces . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the hares and the foxes . the hares waged war with the eagles , and called upon the foxes to help them . they replied , we would willingly have helped you , if we had not known who you were , and with whom you were fighting . count the cost before you commit yourselves . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the bowman and lion . a very skillful bowman went to the mountains in search of game , but all the beasts of the forest fled at his approach . the lion alone challenged him to combat . the bowman immediately shot out an arrow and said to the lion : i send thee my messenger , that from him thou mayest learn what i myself shall be when i assail thee . the wounded lion rushed away in great fear , and when a fox who had seen it all happen told him to be of good courage and not to back off at the first attack he replied : you counsel me in vain ; for if he sends so fearful a messenger , how shall i abide the attack of the man himself ? . be on guard against men who can strike from a distance . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the camel . when man first saw the camel , he was so frightened at his vast size that he ran away . after a time , perceiving the meekness and gentleness of the beast’s temper , he summoned courage enough to approach him . soon afterwards , observing that he was an animal altogether deficient in spirit , he assumed such boldness as to put a bridle in his mouth , and to let a child drive him . use serves to overcome dread . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wasp and the snake . a wasp seated himself upon the head of a snake and , striking him unceasingly with his stings , wounded him to death . the snake , being in great torment and not knowing how to rid himself of his enemy , saw a wagon heavily laden with wood , and went and purposely placed his head under the wheels , saying , at least my enemy and i shall perish together . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the dog and the hare . a hound having started a hare on the hillside pursued her for some distance , at one time biting her with his teeth as if he would take her life , and at another fawning upon her , as if in play with another dog . the hare said to him , i wish you would act sincerely by me , and show yourself in your true colors . if you are a friend , why do you bite me so hard ? if an enemy , why do you fawn on me ? . no one can be a friend if you know not whether to trust or distrust him . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the bull and the calf . a bull was striving with all his might to squeeze himself through a narrow passage which led to his stall . a young calf came up , and offered to go before and show him the way by which he could manage to pass . save yourself the trouble , said the bull ; i knew that way long before you were born . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the stag , the wolf , and the sheep . a stag asked a sheep to lend him a measure of wheat , and said that the wolf would be his surety . the sheep , fearing some fraud was intended , excused herself , saying , the wolf is accustomed to seize what he wants and to run off ; and you , too , can quickly outstrip me in your rapid flight . how then shall i be able to find you , when the day of payment comes ? . two blacks do not make one white . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the peacock and the crane . a peacock spreading its gorgeous tail mocked a crane that passed by , ridiculing the ashen hue of its plumage and saying , i am robed , like a king , in gold and purple and all the colors of the rainbow ; while you have not a bit of color on your wings . true , replied the crane ; but i soar to the heights of heaven and lift up my voice to the stars , while you walk below , like a cock , among the birds of the dunghill . fine feathers don’t make fine birds . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox and the hedgehog . a fox swimming across a rapid river was carried by the force of the current into a very deep ravine , where he lay for a long time very much bruised , sick , and unable to move . a swarm of hungry blood - sucking flies settled upon him . a hedgehog , passing by , saw his anguish and inquired if he should drive away the flies that were tormenting him . by no means , replied the fox ; pray do not molest them . how is this ? said the hedgehog ; do you not want to be rid of them ? no , returned the fox , for these flies which you see are full of blood , and sting me but little , and if you rid me of these which are already satiated , others more hungry will come in their place , and will drink up all the blood i have left . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the eagle , the cat , and the wild sow . an eagle made her nest at the top of a lofty oak ; a cat , having found a convenient hole , moved into the middle of the trunk ; and a wild sow , with her young , took shelter in a hollow at its foot . the cat cunningly resolved to destroy this chance - made colony . to carry out her design , she climbed to the nest of the eagle , and said , destruction is preparing for you , and for me too , unfortunately . the wild sow , whom you see daily digging up the earth , wishes to uproot the oak , so she may on its fall seize our families as food for her young . having thus frightened the eagle out of her senses , she crept down to the cave of the sow , and said , your children are in great danger ; for as soon as you go out with your litter to find food , the eagle is prepared to pounce upon one of your little pigs . having instilled these fears into the sow , she went and pretended to hide herself in the hollow of the tree . when night came she went forth with silent foot and obtained food for herself and her kittens , but feigning to be afraid , she kept a lookout all through the day . meanwhile , the eagle , full of fear of the sow , sat still on the branches , and the sow , terrified by the eagle , did not dare to go out from her cave . and thus they both , along with their families , perished from hunger , and afforded ample provision for the cat and her kittens . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the thief and the innkeeper . a thief hired a room in a tavern and stayed a while in the hope of stealing something which should enable him to pay his reckoning . when he had waited some days in vain , he saw the innkeeper dressed in a new and handsome coat and sitting before his door . the thief sat down beside him and talked with him . as the conversation began to flag , the thief yawned terribly and at the same time howled like a wolf . the innkeeper said , why do you howl so fearfully ? i will tell you , said the thief , but first let me ask you to hold my clothes , or i shall tear them to pieces . i know not , sir , when i got this habit of yawning , nor whether these attacks of howling were inflicted on me as a judgment for my crimes , or for any other cause ; but this i do know , that when i yawn for the third time , i actually turn into a wolf and attack men . with this speech he commenced a second fit of yawning and again howled like a wolf , as he had at first . the innkeeper , hearing his tale and believing what he said , became greatly alarmed and , rising from his seat , attempted to run away . the thief laid hold of his coat and entreated him to stop , saying , pray wait , sir , and hold my clothes , or i shall tear them to pieces in my fury , when i turn into a wolf . at the same moment he yawned the third time and set up a terrible howl . the innkeeper , frightened lest he should be attacked , left his new coat in the thief’s hand and ran as fast as he could into the inn for safety . the thief made off with the coat and did not return again to the inn . every tale is not to be believed . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the mule . a mule , frolicsome from lack of work and from too much corn , galloped about in a very extravagant manner , and said to himself : my father surely was a high - mettled racer , and i am his own child in speed and spirit . on the next day , being driven a long journey , and feeling very wearied , he exclaimed in a disconsolate tone : i must have made a mistake ; my father , after all , could have been only an ass . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the hart and the vine . a hart , hard pressed in the chase , hid himself beneath the large leaves of a vine . the huntsmen , in their haste , overshot the place of his concealment . supposing all danger to have passed , the hart began to nibble the tendrils of the vine . one of the huntsmen , attracted by the rustling of the leaves , looked back , and seeing the hart , shot an arrow from his bow and struck it . the hart , at the point of death , groaned : i am rightly served , for i should not have maltreated the vine that saved me . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the serpent and the eagle . a serpent and an eagle were struggling with each other in deadly conflict . the serpent had the advantage , and was about to strangle the bird . a countryman saw them , and running up , loosed the coil of the serpent and let the eagle go free . the serpent , irritated at the escape of his prey , injected his poison into the drinking horn of the countryman . the rustic , ignorant of his danger , was about to drink , when the eagle struck his hand with his wing , and , seizing the drinking horn in his talons , carried it aloft . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the crow and the pitcher . a crow perishing with thirst saw a pitcher , and hoping to find water , flew to it with delight . when he reached it , he discovered to his grief that it contained so little water that he could not possibly get at it . he tried everything he could think of to reach the water , but all his efforts were in vain . at last he collected as many stones as he could carry and dropped them one by one with his beak into the pitcher , until he brought the water within his reach and thus saved his life . necessity is the mother of invention . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the two frogs . two frogs were neighbors . one inhabited a deep pond , far removed from public view ; the other lived in a gully containing little water , and traversed by a country road . the frog that lived in the pond warned his friend to change his residence and entreated him to come and live with him , saying that he would enjoy greater safety from danger and more abundant food . the other refused , saying that he felt it so very hard to leave a place to which he had become accustomed . a few days afterwards a heavy wagon passed through the gully and crushed him to death under its wheels . a willful man will have his way to his own hurt . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wolf and the fox . at one time a very large and strong wolf was born among the wolves , who exceeded all his fellow - wolves in strength , size , and swiftness , so that they unanimously decided to call him lion . the wolf , with a lack of sense proportioned to his enormous size , thought that they gave him this name in earnest , and , leaving his own race , consorted exclusively with the lions . an old sly fox , seeing this , said , may i never make myself so ridiculous as you do in your pride and self - conceit ; for even though you have the size of a lion among wolves , in a herd of lions you are definitely a wolf . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the walnut - tree . a walnut tree standing by the roadside bore an abundant crop of fruit . for the sake of the nuts , the passers - by broke its branches with stones and sticks . the walnut - tree piteously exclaimed , o wretched me ! that those whom i cheer with my fruit should repay me with these painful requitals ! | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the gnat and the lion . a gnat came and said to a lion , i do not in the least fear you , nor are you stronger than i am . for in what does your strength consist ? you can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth an a woman in her quarrels . i repeat that i am altogether more powerful than you ; and if you doubt it , let us fight and see who will conquer . the gnat , having sounded his horn , fastened himself upon the lion and stung him on the nostrils and the parts of the face devoid of hair . while trying to crush him , the lion tore himself with his claws , until he punished himself severely . the gnat thus prevailed over the lion , and , buzzing about in a song of triumph , flew away . but shortly afterwards he became entangled in the meshes of a cobweb and was eaten by a spider . he greatly lamented his fate , saying , woe is me ! that i , who can wage war successfully with the hugest beasts , should perish myself from this spider , the most inconsiderable of insects ! | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the monkey and the dolphin . a sailor , bound on a long voyage , took with him a monkey to amuse him while on shipboard . as he sailed off the coast of greece , a violent tempest arose in which the ship was wrecked and he , his monkey , and all the crew were obliged to swim for their lives . a dolphin saw the monkey contending with the waves , and supposing him to be a man ( whom he is always said to befriend ) , came and placed himself under him , to convey him on his back in safety to the shore . when the dolphin arrived with his burden in sight of land not far from athens , he asked the monkey if he were an athenian . the latter replied that he was , and that he was descended from one of the most noble families in that city . the dolphin then inquired if he knew the piraeus ( the famous harbor of athens ) . supposing that a man was meant , the monkey answered that he knew him very well and that he was an intimate friend . the dolphin , indignant at these falsehoods , dipped the monkey under the water and drowned him . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the jackdaw and the doves . a jackdaw , seeing some doves in a cote abundantly provided with food , painted himself white and joined them in order to share their plentiful maintenance . the doves , as long as he was silent , supposed him to be one of themselves and admitted him to their cote . but when one day he forgot himself and began to chatter , they discovered his true character and drove him forth , pecking him with their beaks . failing to obtain food among the doves , he returned to the jackdaws . they too , not recognizing him on account of his color , expelled him from living with them . so desiring two ends , he obtained neither . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the horse and the stag . at one time the horse had the plain entirely to himself . then a stag intruded into his domain and shared his pasture . the horse , desiring to revenge himself on the stranger , asked a man if he were willing to help him in punishing the stag . the man replied that if the horse would receive a bit in his mouth and agree to carry him , he would contrive effective weapons against the stag . the horse consented and allowed the man to mount him . from that hour he found that instead of obtaining revenge on the stag , he had enslaved himself to the service of man . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the kid and the wolf . a kid , returning without protection from the pasture , was pursued by a wolf . seeing he could not escape , he turned round , and said : i know , friend wolf , that i must be your prey , but before i die i would ask of you one favor you will play me a tune to which i may dance . the wolf complied , and while he was piping and the kid was dancing , some hounds hearing the sound ran up and began chasing the wolf . turning to the kid , he said , it is just what i deserve ; for i , who am only a butcher , should not have turned piper to please you . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the prophet . a wizard , sitting in the marketplace , was telling the fortunes of the passers - by when a person ran up in great haste , and announced to him that the doors of his house had been broken open and that all his goods were being stolen . he sighed heavily and hastened away as fast as he could run . a neighbor saw him running and said , oh ! you fellow there ! you say you can foretell the fortunes of others ; how is it you did not foresee your own ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox and the monkey . a fox and a monkey were traveling together on the same road . as they journeyed , they passed through a cemetery full of monuments . all these monuments which you see , said the monkey , are erected in honor of my ancestors , who were in their day freedmen and citizens of great renown . the fox replied , you have chosen a most appropriate subject for your falsehoods , as i am sure none of your ancestors will be able to contradict you . a false tale often betrays itself . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the thief and the housedog . a thief came in the night to break into a house . he brought with him several slices of meat in order to pacify the housedog , so that he would not alarm his master by barking . as the thief threw him the pieces of meat , the dog said , if you think to stop my mouth , you will be greatly mistaken . this sudden kindness at your hands will only make me more watchful , lest under these unexpected favors to myself , you have some private ends to accomplish for your own benefit , and for my master’s injury . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the man , the horse , the ox , and the dog . a horse , ox , and dog , driven to great straits by the cold , sought shelter and protection from man . he received them kindly , lighted a fire , and warmed them . he let the horse make free with his oats , gave the ox an abundance of hay , and fed the dog with meat from his own table . grateful for these favors , the animals determined to repay him to the best of their ability . for this purpose , they divided the term of his life between them , and each endowed one portion of it with the qualities which chiefly characterized himself . the horse chose his earliest years and gave them his own attributes : hence every man is in his youth impetuous , headstrong , and obstinate in maintaining his own opinion . the ox took under his patronage the next term of life , and therefore man in his middle age is fond of work , devoted to labor , and resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources . the end of life was reserved for the dog , wherefore the old man is often snappish , irritable , hard to please , and selfish , tolerant only of his own household , but averse to strangers and to all who do not administer to his comfort or to his necessities . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the apes and the two travelers . two men , one who always spoke the truth and the other who told nothing but lies , were traveling together and by chance came to the land of apes . one of the apes , who had raised himself to be king , commanded them to be seized and brought before him , that he might know what was said of him among men . he ordered at the same time that all the apes be arranged in a long row on his right hand and on his left , and that a throne be placed for him , as was the custom among men . after these preparations he signified that the two men should be brought before him , and greeted them with this salutation : what sort of a king do i seem to you to be , o strangers ? the lying traveler replied , you seem to me a most mighty king . and what is your estimate of those you see around me ? these , . he made answer , are worthy companions of yourself , fit at least to be ambassadors and leaders of armies . the ape and all his court , gratified with the lie , commanded that a handsome present be given to the flatterer . on this the truthful traveler thought to himself , if so great a reward be given for a lie , with what gift may not i be rewarded , if , according to my custom , i tell the truth ? the ape quickly turned to him . and pray how do i and these my friends around me seem to you ? . thou art , he said , a most excellent ape , and all these thy companions after thy example are excellent apes too . the king of the apes , enraged at hearing these truths , gave him over to the teeth and claws of his companions . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wolf and the shepherd . a wolf followed a flock of sheep for a long time and did not attempt to injure one of them . the shepherd at first stood on his guard against him , as against an enemy , and kept a strict watch over his movements . but when the wolf , day after day , kept in the company of the sheep and did not make the slightest effort to seize them , the shepherd began to look upon him as a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it ; and when occasion called him one day into the city , he left the sheep entirely in his charge . the wolf , now that he had the opportunity , fell upon the sheep , and destroyed the greater part of the flock . when the shepherd returned to find his flock destroyed , he exclaimed : i have been rightly served ; why did i trust my sheep to a wolf ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the hares and the lions . the hares harangued the assembly , and argued that all should be equal . the lions made this reply : your words , o hares ! are good ; but they lack both claws and teeth such as we have . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lark and her young ones . a lark had made her nest in the early spring on the young green wheat . the brood had almost grown to their full strength and attained the use of their wings and the full plumage of their feathers , when the owner of the field , looking over his ripe crop , said , the time has come when i must ask all my neighbors to help me with my harvest . one of the young larks heard his speech and related it to his mother , inquiring of her to what place they should move for safety . there is no occasion to move yet , my son , she replied ; the man who only sends to his friends to help him with his harvest is not really in earnest . the owner of the field came again a few days later and saw the wheat shedding the grain from excess of ripeness . he said , i will come myself tomorrow with my laborers , and with as many reapers as i can hire , and will get in the harvest . the lark on hearing these words said to her brood , it is time now to be off , my little ones , for the man is in earnest this time ; he no longer trusts his friends , but will reap the field himself . self - help is the best help . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox and the lion . when a fox who had never yet seen a lion , fell in with him by chance for the first time in the forest , he was so frightened that he nearly died with fear . on meeting him for the second time , he was still much alarmed , but not to the same extent as at first . on seeing him the third time , he so increased in boldness that he went up to him and commenced a familiar conversation with him . acquaintance softens prejudices . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the weasel and the mice . a weasel , inactive from age and infirmities , was not able to catch mice as he once did . he therefore rolled himself in flour and lay down in a dark corner . a mouse , supposing him to be food , leaped upon him , and was instantly caught and squeezed to death . another perished in a similar manner , and then a third , and still others after them . a very old mouse , who had escaped many a trap and snare , observed from a safe distance the trick of his crafty foe and said , ah ! you that lie there , may you prosper just in the same proportion as you are what you pretend to be ! | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the boy bathing . a boy bathing in a river was in danger of being drowned . he called out to a passing traveler for help , but instead of holding out a helping hand , the man stood by unconcernedly , and scolded the boy for his imprudence . oh , sir ! cried the youth , pray help me now and scold me afterwards . counsel without help is useless . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass and the wolf . an ass feeding in a meadow saw a wolf approaching to seize him , and immediately pretended to be lame . the wolf , coming up , inquired the cause of his lameness . the ass replied that passing through a hedge he had trod with his foot upon a sharp thorn . he requested that the wolf pull it out , lest when he ate him it should injure his throat . the wolf consented and lifted up the foot , and was giving his whole mind to the discovery of the thorn , when the ass , with his heels , kicked his teeth into his mouth and galloped away . the wolf , being thus fearfully mauled , said , i am rightly served , for why did i attempt the art of healing , when my father only taught me the trade of a butcher ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the seller of images . a certain man made a wooden image of mercury and offered it for sale . when no one appeared willing to buy it , in order to attract purchasers , he cried out that he had the statue to sell of a benefactor who bestowed wealth and helped to heap up riches . one of the bystanders said to him , my good fellow , why do you sell him , being such a one as you describe , when you may yourself enjoy the good things he has to give ? why , he replied , i am in need of immediate help , and he is wont to give his good gifts very slowly . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox and the grapes . a famished fox saw some clusters of ripe black grapes hanging from a trellised vine . she resorted to all her tricks to get at them , but wearied herself in vain , for she could not reach them . at last she turned away , hiding her disappointment and saying : the grapes are sour , and not ripe as i thought . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the man and his wife . a man had a wife who made herself hated by all the members of his household . wishing to find out if she had the same effect on the persons in her father’s house , he made some excuse to send her home on a visit to her father . after a short time she returned , and when he inquired how she had got on and how the servants had treated her , she replied , the herdsmen and shepherds cast on me looks of aversion . he said , o wife , if you were disliked by those who go out early in the morning with their flocks and return late in the evening , what must have been felt towards you by those with whom you passed the whole day ! . straws show how the wind blows . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the peacock and juno . the peacock made complaint to juno that , while the nightingale pleased every ear with his song , he himself no sooner opened his mouth than he became a laughingstock to all who heard him . the goddess , to console him , said , but you far excel in beauty and in size . the splendor of the emerald shines in your neck and you unfold a tail gorgeous with painted plumage . but for what purpose have i , said the bird , this dumb beauty so long as i am surpassed in song ? the lot of each , replied juno , has been assigned by the will of the fates - - to thee , beauty ; to the eagle , strength ; to the nightingale , song ; to the raven , favorable , and to the crow , unfavorable auguries . these are all contented with the endowments allotted to them . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the hawk and the nightingale . a nightingale , sitting aloft upon an oak and singing according to his wont , was seen by a hawk who , being in need of food , swooped down and seized him . the nightingale , about to lose his life , earnestly begged the hawk to let him go , saying that he was not big enough to satisfy the hunger of a hawk who , if he wanted food , ought to pursue the larger birds . the hawk , interrupting him , said : i should indeed have lost my senses if i should let go food ready in my hand , for the sake of pursuing birds which are not yet even within sight . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the dog , the cock , and the fox . a dog and a cock being great friends , agreed to travel together . at nightfall they took shelter in a thick wood . the cock flying up , perched himself on the branches of a tree , while the dog found a bed beneath in the hollow trunk . when the morning dawned , the cock , as usual , crowed very loudly several times . a fox heard the sound , and wishing to make a breakfast on him , came and stood under the branches , saying how earnestly he desired to make the acquaintance of the owner of so magnificent a voice . the cock , suspecting his civilities , said : sir , i wish you would do me the favor of going around to the hollow trunk below me , and waking my porter , so that he may open the door and let you in . when the fox approached the tree , the dog sprang out and caught him , and tore him to pieces . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wolf and the goat . a wolf saw a goat feeding at the summit of a steep precipice , where he had no chance of reaching her . he called to her and earnestly begged her to come lower down , lest she fall by some mishap ; and he added that the meadows lay where he was standing , and that the herbage was most tender . she replied , no , my friend , it is not for the pasture that you invite me , but for yourself , who are in want of food . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lion and the bull . a lion , greatly desiring to capture a bull , and yet afraid to attack him on account of his great size , resorted to a trick to ensure his destruction . he approached the bull and said , i have slain a fine sheep , my friend ; and if you will come home and partake of him with me , i shall be delighted to have your company . the lion said this in the hope that , as the bull was in the act of reclining to eat , he might attack him to advantage , and make his meal on him . the bull , on approaching the lion’s den , saw the huge spits and giant caldrons , and no sign whatever of the sheep , and , without saying a word , quietly took his departure . the lion inquired why he went off so abruptly without a word of salutation to his host , who had not given him any cause for offense . i have reasons enough , said the bull . i see no indication whatever of your having slaughtered a sheep , while i do see very plainly every preparation for your dining on a bull . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | . the goat and the ass . a man once kept a goat and an ass . the goat , envying the ass on account of his greater abundance of food , said , how shamefully you are treated : at one time grinding in the mill , and at another carrying heavy burdens ; and he further advised him to pretend to be epileptic and fall into a ditch and so obtain rest . the ass listened to his words , and falling into a ditch , was very much bruised . his master , sending for a leech , asked his advice . he bade him pour upon the wounds the lungs of a goat . they at once killed the goat , and so healed the ass . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the town mouse and the country mouse . a country mouse invited a town mouse , an intimate friend , to pay him a visit and partake of his country fare . as they were on the bare plowlands , eating there wheat - stocks and roots pulled up from the hedgerow , the town mouse said to his friend , you live here the life of the ants , while in my house is the horn of plenty . i am surrounded by every luxury , and if you will come with me , as i wish you would , you shall have an ample share of my dainties . the country mouse was easily persuaded , and returned to town with his friend . on his arrival , the town mouse placed before him bread , barley , beans , dried figs , honey , raisins , and , last of all , brought a dainty piece of cheese from a basket . the country mouse , being much delighted at the sight of such good cheer , expressed his satisfaction in warm terms and lamented his own hard fate . just as they were beginning to eat , someone opened the door , and they both ran off squeaking , as fast as they could , to a hole so narrow that two could only find room in it by squeezing . they had scarcely begun their repast again when someone else entered to take something out of a cupboard , whereupon the two mice , more frightened than before , ran away and hid themselves . at last the country mouse , almost famished , said to his friend : although you have prepared for me so dainty a feast , i must leave you to enjoy it by yourself . it is surrounded by too many dangers to please me . i prefer my bare plowlands and roots from the hedgerow , where i can live in safety , and without fear . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wolf , the fox , and the ape . a wolf accused a fox of theft , but the fox entirely denied the charge . an ape undertook to adjudge the matter between them . when each had fully stated his case the ape announced this sentence : i do not think you , wolf , ever lost what you claim ; and i do believe you , fox , to have stolen what you so stoutly deny . the dishonest , if they act honestly , get no credit . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fly and the draught - mule . a fly sat on the axle - tree of a chariot , and addressing the draught - mule said , how slow you are ! why do you not go faster ? see if i do not prick your neck with my sting . the draught - mule replied , i do not heed your threats ; i only care for him who sits above you , and who quickens my pace with his whip , or holds me back with the reins . away , therefore , with your insolence , for i know well when to go fast , and when to go slow . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fishermen . some fishermen were out trawling their nets . perceiving them to be very heavy , they danced about for joy and supposed that they had taken a large catch . when they had dragged the nets to the shore they found but few fish : the nets were full of sand and stones , and the men were beyond measure cast down so much at the disappointment which had befallen them , but because they had formed such very different expectations . one of their company , an old man , said , let us cease lamenting , my mates , for , as it seems to me , sorrow is always the twin sister of joy ; and it was only to be looked for that we , who just now were over - rejoiced , should next have something to make us sad . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lion and the three bulls . three bulls for a long time pastured together . a lion lay in ambush in the hope of making them his prey , but was afraid to attack them while they kept together . having at last by guileful speeches succeeded in separating them , he attacked them without fear as they fed alone , and feasted on them one by one at his own leisure . union is strength . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fowler and the viper . a fowler , taking his bird - lime and his twigs , went out to catch birds . seeing a thrush sitting upon a tree , he wished to take it , and fitting his twigs to a proper length , watched intently , having his whole thoughts directed towards the sky . while thus looking upwards , he unknowingly trod upon a viper asleep just before his feet . the viper , turning about , stung him , and falling into a swoon , the man said to himself , woe is me ! that while i purposed to hunt another , i am myself fallen unawares into the snares of death . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the horse and the ass . a horse , proud of his fine trappings , met an ass on the highway . the ass , being heavily laden , moved slowly out of the way . hardly , said the horse , can i resist kicking you with my heels . the ass held his peace , and made only a silent appeal to the justice of the gods . not long afterwards the horse , having become broken - winded , was sent by his owner to the farm . the ass , seeing him drawing a dungcart , thus derided him : where , o boaster , are now all thy gay trappings , thou who are thyself reduced to the condition you so lately treated with contempt ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox and the mask . a fox entered the house of an actor and , rummaging through all his properties , came upon a mask , an admirable imitation of a human head . he placed his paws on it and said , what a beautiful head ! yet it is of no value , as it entirely lacks brains . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the geese and the cranes . the geese and the cranes were feeding in the same meadow , when a birdcatcher came to ensnare them in his nets . the cranes , being light of wing , fled away at his approach ; while the geese , being slower of flight and heavier in their bodies , were captured . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the blind man and the whelp . a blind man was accustomed to distinguishing different animals by touching them with his hands . the whelp of a wolf was brought him , with a request that he would feel it , and say what it was . he felt it , and being in doubt , said : i do not quite know whether it is the cub of a fox , or the whelp of a wolf , but this i know full well . it would not be safe to admit him to the sheepfold . evil tendencies are shown in early life . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the dogs and the fox . some dogs , finding the skin of a lion , began to tear it in pieces with their teeth . a fox , seeing them , said , if this lion were alive , you would soon find out that his claws were stronger than your teeth . it is easy to kick a man that is down . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the cobbler turned doctor . a cobbler unable to make a living by his trade and made desperate by poverty , began to practice medicine in a town in which he was not known . he sold a drug , pretending that it was an antidote to all poisons , and obtained a great name for himself by long - winded puffs and advertisements . when the cobbler happened to fall sick himself of a serious illness , the governor of the town determined to test his skill . for this purpose he called for a cup , and while filling it with water , pretended to mix poison with the cobbler’s antidote , commanding him to drink it on the promise of a reward . the cobbler , under the fear of death , confessed that he had no knowledge of medicine , and was only made famous by the stupid clamors of the crowd . the governor then called a public assembly and addressed the citizens : of what folly have you been guilty ? you have not hesitated to entrust your heads to a man , whom no one could employ to make even the shoes for their feet . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wolf and the horse . a wolf coming out of a field of oats met a horse and thus addressed him : i would advise you to go into that field . it is full of fine oats , which i have left untouched for you , as you are a friend whom i would love to hear enjoying good eating . the horse replied , if oats had been the food of wolves , you would never have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly . men of evil reputation , when they perform a good deed , fail to get credit for it . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the brother and the sister . a father had one son and one daughter , the former remarkable for his good looks , the latter for her extraordinary ugliness . while they were playing one day as children , they happened by chance to look together into a mirror that was placed on their mother’s chair . the boy congratulated himself on his good looks ; the girl grew angry , and could not bear the self - praises of her brother , interpreting all he said ( and how could she do otherwise ? ) into reflection on herself . she ran off to her father , to be avenged on her brother , and spitefully accused him of having , as a boy , made use of that which belonged only to girls . the father embraced them both , and bestowing his kisses and affection impartially on each , said , i wish you both would look into the mirror every day : you , my son , that you may not spoil your beauty by evil conduct ; and you , my daughter , that you may make up for your lack of beauty by your virtues . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wasps , the partridges , and the farmer . the wasps and the partridges , overcome with thirst , came to a farmer and besought him to give them some water to drink . they promised amply to repay him the favor which they asked . the partridges declared that they would dig around his vines and make them produce finer grapes . the wasps said that they would keep guard and drive off thieves with their stings . but the farmer interrupted them , saying : i have already two oxen , who , without making any promises , do all these things . it is surely better for me to give the water to them than to you . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the crow and mercury . a crow caught in a snare prayed to apollo to release him , making a vow to offer some frankincense at his shrine . but when rescued from his danger , he forgot his promise . shortly afterwards , again caught in a snare , he passed by apollo and made the same promise to offer frankincense to mercury . mercury soon appeared and said to him , o thou most base fellow ? how can i believe thee , who hast disowned and wronged thy former patron ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the north wind and the sun . the north wind and the sun disputed as to which was the most powerful , and agreed that he should be declared the victor who could first strip a wayfaring man of his clothes . the north wind first tried his power and blew with all his might , but the keener his blasts , the closer the traveler wrapped his cloak around him , until at last , resigning all hope of victory , the wind called upon the sun to see what he could do . the sun suddenly shone out with all his warmth . the traveler no sooner felt his genial rays than he took off one garment after another , and at last , fairly overcome with heat , undressed and bathed in a stream that lay in his path . persuasion is better than force . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the two men who were enemies . two men , deadly enemies to each other , were sailing in the same vessel . determined to keep as far apart as possible , the one seated himself in the stem , and the other in the prow of the ship . a violent storm arose , and with the vessel in great danger of sinking , the one in the stern inquired of the pilot which of the two ends of the ship would go down first . on his replying that he supposed it would be the prow , the man said , death would not be grievous to me , if i could only see my enemy die before me . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the gamecocks and the partridge . a man had two gamecocks in his poultry - yard . one day by chance he found a tame partridge for sale . he purchased it and brought it home to be reared with his gamecocks . when the partridge was put into the poultry - yard , they struck at it and followed it about , so that the partridge became grievously troubled and supposed that he was thus evilly treated because he was a stranger . not long afterwards he saw the cocks fighting together and not separating before one had well beaten the other . he then said to himself , i shall no longer distress myself at being struck at by these gamecocks , when i see that they cannot even refrain from quarreling with each other . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the quack frog . a frog once upon a time came forth from his home in the marsh and proclaimed to all the beasts that he was a learned physician , skilled in the use of drugs and able to heal all diseases . a fox asked him , how can you pretend to prescribe for others , when you are unable to heal your own lame gait and wrinkled skin ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lion , the wolf , and the fox . a lion , growing old , lay sick in his cave . all the beasts came to visit their king , except the fox . the wolf therefore , thinking that he had a capital opportunity , accused the fox to the lion of not paying any respect to him who had the rule over them all and of not coming to visit him . at that very moment the fox came in and heard these last words of the wolf . the lion roaring out in a rage against him , the fox sought an opportunity to defend himself and said , and who of all those who have come to you have benefited you so much as i , who have traveled from place to place in every direction , and have sought and learnt from the physicians the means of healing you ? the lion commanded him immediately to tell him the cure , when he replied , you must flay a wolf alive and wrap his skin yet warm around you . the wolf was at once taken and flayed ; whereon the fox , turning to him , said with a smile , you should have moved your master not to ill , but to good , will . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the dog’s house . in the wintertime , a dog curled up in as small a space as possible on account of the cold , determined to make himself a house . however when the summer returned again , he lay asleep stretched at his full length and appeared to himself to be of a great size . now he considered that it would be neither an easy nor a necessary work to make himself such a house as would accommodate him . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the wolf and the lion . roaming by the mountainside at sundown , a wolf saw his own shadow become greatly extended and magnified , and he said to himself , why should i , being of such an immense size and extending nearly an acre in length , be afraid of the lion ? ought i not to be acknowledged as king of all the collected beasts ? while he was indulging in these proud thoughts , a lion fell upon him and killed him . he exclaimed with a too late repentance , wretched me ! this overestimation of myself is the cause of my destruction . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the birds , the beasts , and the bat . the birds waged war with the beasts , and each were by turns the conquerors . a bat , fearing the uncertain issues of the fight , always fought on the side which he felt was the strongest . when peace was proclaimed , his deceitful conduct was apparent to both combatants . therefore being condemned by each for his treachery , he was driven forth from the light of day , and henceforth concealed himself in dark hiding - places , flying always alone and at night . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the spendthrift and the swallow . a young man , a great spendthrift , had run through all his patrimony and had but one good cloak left . one day he happened to see a swallow , which had appeared before its season , skimming along a pool and twittering gaily . he supposed that summer had come , and went and sold his cloak . not many days later , winter set in again with renewed frost and cold . when he found the unfortunate swallow lifeless on the ground , he said , unhappy bird ! what have you done ? by thus appearing before the springtime you have not only killed yourself , but you have wrought my destruction also . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the fox and the lion . a fox saw a lion confined in a cage , and standing near him , bitterly reviled him . the lion said to the fox , it is not thou who revilest me ; but this mischance which has befallen me . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the owl and the birds . an owl , in her wisdom , counseled the birds that when the acorn first began to sprout , to pull it all up out of the ground and not allow it to grow . she said acorns would produce mistletoe , from which an irremediable poison , the bird - lime , would be extracted and by which they would be captured . the owl next advised them to pluck up the seed of the flax , which men had sown , as it was a plant which boded no good to them . and , lastly , the owl , seeing an archer approach , predicted that this man , being on foot , would contrive darts armed with feathers which would fly faster than the wings of the birds themselves . the birds gave no credence to these warning words , but considered the owl to be beside herself and said that she was mad . but afterwards , finding her words were true , they wondered at her knowledge and deemed her to be the wisest of birds . hence it is that when she appears they look to her as knowing all things , while she no longer gives them advice , but in solitude laments their past folly . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the trumpeter taken prisoner . a trumpeter , bravely leading on the soldiers , was captured by the enemy . he cried out to his captors , pray spare me , and do not take my life without cause or without inquiry . i have not slain a single man of your troop . i have no arms , and carry nothing but this one brass trumpet . that is the very reason for which you should be put to death , they said ; for , while you do not fight yourself , your trumpet stirs all the others to battle . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass in the lion’s skin . an ass , having put on the lion’s skin , roamed about in the forest and amused himself by frightening all the foolish animals he met in his wanderings . at last coming upon a fox , he tried to frighten him also , but the fox no sooner heard the sound of his voice than he exclaimed , i might possibly have been frightened myself , if i had not heard your bray . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the sparrow and the hare . a hare pounced upon by an eagle sobbed very much and uttered cries like a child . a sparrow upbraided her and said , where now is thy remarkable swiftness of foot ? why were your feet so slow ? while the sparrow was thus speaking , a hawk suddenly seized him and killed him . the hare was comforted in her death , and expiring said , ah ! you who so lately , when you supposed yourself safe , exulted over my calamity , have now reason to deplore a similar misfortune . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the flea and the ox . a flea thus questioned an ox : what ails you , that being so huge and strong , you submit to the wrongs you receive from men and slave for them day by day , while i , being so small a creature , mercilessly feed on their flesh and drink their blood without stint ? the ox replied : i do not wish to be ungrateful , for i am loved and well cared for by men , and they often pat my head and shoulders . woe’s me ! said the flea ; this very patting which you like , whenever it happens to me , brings with it my inevitable destruction . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the goods and the ills . all the goods were once driven out by the ills from that common share which they each had in the affairs of mankind ; for the ills by reason of their numbers had prevailed to possess the earth . the goods wafted themselves to heaven and asked for a righteous vengeance on their persecutors . they entreated jupiter that they might no longer be associated with the ills , as they had nothing in common and could not live together , but were engaged in unceasing warfare ; and that an indissoluble law might be laid down for their future protection . jupiter granted their request and decreed that henceforth the ills should visit the earth in company with each other , but that the goods should one by one enter the habitations of men . hence it arises that ills abound , for they come not one by one , but in troops , and by no means singly : while the goods proceed from jupiter , and are given , not alike to all , but singly , and separately ; and one by one to those who are able to discern them . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the dove and the crow . a dove shut up in a cage was boasting of the large number of young ones which she had hatched . a crow hearing her , said : my good friend , cease from this unseasonable boasting . the larger the number of your family , the greater your cause of sorrow , in seeing them shut up in this prison - house . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | mercury and the workmen . a workman , felling wood by the side of a river , let his axe drop by accident into a deep pool . being thus deprived of the means of his livelihood , he sat down on the bank and lamented his hard fate . mercury appeared and demanded the cause of his tears . after he told him his misfortune , mercury plunged into the stream , and , bringing up a golden axe , inquired if that were the one he had lost . on his saying that it was not his , mercury disappeared beneath the water a second time , returned with a silver axe in his hand , and again asked the workman if it were his . when the workman said it was not , he dived into the pool for the third time and brought up the axe that had been lost . the workman claimed it and expressed his joy at its recovery . mercury , pleased with his honesty , gave him the golden and silver axes in addition to his own . the workman , on his return to his house , related to his companions all that had happened . one of them at once resolved to try and secure the same good fortune for himself . he ran to the river and threw his axe on purpose into the pool at the same place , and sat down on the bank to weep . mercury appeared to him just as he hoped he would ; and having learned the cause of his grief , plunged into the stream and brought up a golden axe , inquiring if he had lost it . the workman seized it greedily , and declared that truly it was the very same axe that he had lost . mercury , displeased at his knavery , not only took away the golden axe , but refused to recover for him the axe he had thrown into the pool . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the eagle and the jackdaw . an eagle , flying down from his perch on a lofty rock , seized upon a lamb and carried him aloft in his talons . a jackdaw , who witnessed the capture of the lamb , was stirred with envy and determined to emulate the strength and flight of the eagle . he flew around with a great whir of his wings and settled upon a large ram , with the intention of carrying him off , but his claws became entangled in the ram’s fleece and he was not able to release himself , although he fluttered with his feathers as much as he could . the shepherd , seeing what had happened , ran up and caught him . he at once clipped the jackdaw’s wings , and taking him home at night , gave him to his children . on their saying , father , what kind of bird is it ? he replied , to my certain knowledge he is a daw ; but he would like you to think an eagle . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | . the fox and the crane . a fox invited a crane to supper and provided nothing for his entertainment but some soup made of pulse , which was poured out into a broad flat stone dish . the soup fell out of the long bill of the crane at every mouthful , and his vexation at not being able to eat afforded the fox much amusement . the crane , in his turn , asked the fox to sup with him , and set before her a flagon with a long narrow mouth , so that he could easily insert his neck and enjoy its contents at his leisure . the fox , unable even to taste it , met with a fitting requital , after the fashion of her own hospitality . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | jupiter , neptune , minerva , and momus . according to an ancient legend , the first man was made by jupiter , the first bull by neptune , and the first house by minerva . on the completion of their labors , a dispute arose as to which had made the most perfect work . they agreed to appoint momus as judge , and to abide by his decision . momus , however , being very envious of the handicraft of each , found fault with all . he first blamed the work of neptune because he had not made the horns of the bull below his eyes , so he might better see where to strike . he then condemned the work of jupiter , because he had not placed the heart of man on the outside , that everyone might read the thoughts of the evil disposed and take precautions against the intended mischief . and , lastly , he inveighed against minerva because she had not contrived iron wheels in the foundation of her house , so its inhabitants might more easily remove if a neighbor proved unpleasant . jupiter , indignant at such inveterate faultfinding , drove him from his office of judge , and expelled him from the mansions of olympus . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the eagle and the fox . an eagle and a fox formed an intimate friendship and decided to live near each other . the eagle built her nest in the branches of a tall tree , while the fox crept into the underwood and there produced her young . not long after they had agreed upon this plan , the eagle , being in want of provision for her young ones , swooped down while the fox was out , seized upon one of the little cubs , and feasted herself and her brood . the fox on her return , discovered what had happened , but was less grieved for the death of her young than for her inability to avenge them . a just retribution , however , quickly fell upon the eagle . while hovering near an altar , on which some villagers were sacrificing a goat , she suddenly seized a piece of the flesh , and carried it , along with a burning cinder , to her nest . a strong breeze soon fanned the spark into a flame , and the eaglets , as yet unfledged and helpless , were roasted in their nest and dropped down dead at the bottom of the tree . there , in the sight of the eagle , the fox gobbled them up . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the man and the satyr . a man and a satyr once drank together in token of a bond of alliance being formed between them . one very cold wintry day , as they talked , the man put his fingers to his mouth and blew on them . when the satyr asked the reason for this , he told him that he did it to warm his hands because they were so cold . later on in the day they sat down to eat , and the food prepared was quite scalding . the man raised one of the dishes a little towards his mouth and blew in it . when the satyr again inquired the reason , he said that he did it to cool the meat , which was too hot . i can no longer consider you as a friend , said the satyr , a fellow who with the same breath blows hot and cold . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass and his purchaser . a man wished to purchase an ass , and agreed with its owner that he should try out the animal before he bought him . he took the ass home and put him in the straw - yard with his other asses , upon which the new animal left all the others and at once joined the one that was most idle and the greatest eater of them all . seeing this , the man put a halter on him and led him back to his owner . on being asked how , in so short a time , he could have made a trial of him , he answered , i do not need a trial ; i know that he will be just the same as the one he chose for his companion . a man is known by the company he keeps . |

and exerting his utmost speed , as long as the plain was smooth and open kept himself easily at a safe distance from the lion . but entering a wood he became entangled by his horns , and the lion quickly came up to him and caught him . when too late , he thus reproached himself : woe is me ! how i have deceived myself ! these feet which would have saved me i despised , and i gloried in these antlers which have proved my destruction . what is most truly valuable is often underrated . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the jackdaw and the fox . a half - famished jackdaw seated himself

fought with the robber made answer , i only wish that you had helped me just now , even if it had been only with those words , for i should have been the more encouraged , believing them to be true ;

right well that no dependence can be placed on your valor . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the trees under the protection of the gods . the gods , according to an ancient legend , made choice

| | the buffoon and the countryman . a rich nobleman once opened the theaters without charge to the people , and gave a public notice that he would handsomely reward any person who invented a new amusement for the occasion . various public performers contended for the prize . among them came a buffoon well known among the populace for his jokes , and said that he had a kind of entertainment which had never been brought out on any stage before . this report being spread about made a great stir , and the theater was crowded in every part . the buffoon appeared alone upon the platform , without any apparatus or confederates , and the very sense of expectation caused an intense silence . he suddenly bent his head towards his bosom and imitated the squeaking of a little pig so admirably with his voice that the audience declared he had a porker under his cloak , and demanded that it should be shaken out . when that was done and nothing was found , they cheered the actor , and loaded him with the loudest applause . a countryman in the crowd , observing all that has passed , said , so help me , hercules , he shall not beat me at that trick ! and at once proclaimed that he would do the same thing on the next day , though in a much more natural way . on the morrow a still larger crowd assembled in the theater , but now partiality for their favorite actor very generally prevailed , and the audience came rather to ridicule the countryman than to see the spectacle . both of the performers appeared on the stage . the buffoon grunted and squeaked away first , and obtained , as on the preceding day , the applause and cheers of the spectators . next the countryman commenced , and pretending that he concealed a little pig beneath his clothes ( which in truth he did , but not suspected by the audience ) contrived to take hold of and to pull his ear causing the pig to squeak . the crowd , however , cried out with one consent that the buffoon had given a far more exact imitation , and clamored for the countryman to be kicked out of the theater . on this the rustic produced the little pig from his cloak and showed by the most positive proof the greatness of their mistake . look here , he said , this shows what sort of judges you are . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the crow and the serpent . a crow in great want of food saw a serpent asleep

his amusement with all kinds of life - sized animals , among which was the picture of a lion . when the young prince saw this , his grief at being thus confined burst out afresh , and , standing near the lion , he said : o you most detestable of animals ! through a lying dream of my father’s , which he saw in his sleep , i am shut up on your account in this palace as if i had been a girl : what shall i now do to you ? with these words he stretched out his hands toward a thorn - tree , meaning to cut a stick from its branches so that he might beat the lion . but one of the tree’s prickles pierced his finger and caused great pain and inflammation , so that the young prince fell down in a fainting fit . a violent fever suddenly set in , from which he died not many days later . we had

matters little if those who are inferior to us in merit should be like us in outside appearances . the camel and the arab . an arab camel - driver , after completing the loading of his camel , asked him which he would like best , to go up hill or down . the poor beast replied , not without a touch of reason : why do you ask me ? is it that the level way through the desert is closed ? | | | | | |

women collected round a well , talking and laughing . look there , cried one of them , did you ever see such fellows , to be trudging along the road on foot when they might ride ? the old man hearing this , quickly made his son mount the ass , and continued to walk along merrily by his side . presently they came up to a group of old men in earnest debate . there , . said one of them , it proves what i was a - saying . what respect is shown to old age in these days ? do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk ? get down , you young scapegrace , and let the old man rest his weary limbs . upon this the old man made his son dismount , and got up himself . in this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of women and children : why , you lazy old fellow , cried several tongues at once , how can you ride upon the beast , while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you ? the good - natured miller immediately took up his son behind him . they had now almost reached the town . pray , honest friend , said a citizen , is that ass your own ? yes , replied the old man . o , one would not have thought so , said the other , by the way you load him . why , you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you . anything to please you , said the old man ; we can but try . so , alighting with his son , they tied the legs of the ass together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town . this entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it , till the ass , not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was subject to , broke the cords that bound him and , tumbling off the pole , fell into the river . upon this , the old man , vexed and ashamed , made the best of his way home again , convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody , and lost his ass in the bargain . | | | | | | | | | |

serviceable to men . i wake them up in the night to their work . that is the very reason why we must the more kill you , they replied ; for when you wake your neighbors , you entirely put an end to our business . the safeguards of virtue are hateful to those with evil intentions . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the dog and the cook . a rich man gave a great feast , to which he invited

not often get such a chance as this . i will take care and eat enough to last me both today and tomorrow . while he was congratulating himself and wagging his tail to convey his pleasure to his friend

! it bears no fruit , and is not of the least service to man . the plane - tree , interrupting him , said , you ungrateful fellows ! do you , while receiving benefits from me and resting under my

all the attributes which i possess myself , and your courage never fails you except in this one instance . on hearing this the lion groaned and lamented very much and , reproaching himself with his cowardice , wished that he might die . as these thoughts passed through his mind , he met an elephant and came close to hold a conversation with him . after a time he observed that the elephant shook his ears very often , and he inquired what was the matter and why his ears moved with such a tremor every now and then . just at that moment a gnat settled on the head of the elephant , and he replied , do you see that little buzzing insect ? if it enters my ear , my fate is sealed . i should die presently . the lion said , well , since so huge a beast is afraid of a tiny gnat , i will no more complain , nor wish myself dead . i find myself , even as i am , better off than the elephant . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the lamb and the wolf . a wolf pursued a lamb , which fled for

. all of a sudden robbers rushed upon them from their hiding - places , and in the scuffle with their owners , wounded with a sword the mule carrying the treasure , which they greedily seized while taking no notice of the grain . the mule which had been robbed and wounded bewailed his misfortunes . the other replied , i am indeed glad that i was thought so little of , for i have lost nothing ,

to be cast to the lions as the punishment for his imputed crime . but when the lion was released from his cage , he recognized the shepherd as the man who healed him , and instead of attacking him , approached and placed his foot upon his lap . the king , as soon as he heard the tale , ordered the lion to be set free again in the forest , and the shepherd to be pardoned and restored to his friends . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the camel and jupiter . the camel , when he saw the bull adorned with horns , envied him and wished that he himself could obtain the same honors . he

discovered him , and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with stones , while others , moved with compassion towards one about to die even though no one should hurt him , threw in some food to prolong his life . at night they returned home , not dreaming of any danger , but supposing that on the morrow they would find him dead . the panther , however , when he had recruited his feeble strength , freed himself with a sudden bound from the pit , and hastened to his den with rapid steps . after a few days he came forth and slaughtered the cattle , and , killing the shepherds who had attacked him , raged with angry fury . then they who had spared his life , fearing for their safety , surrendered to him their flocks and begged only for their lives . to them the panther made this reply : i remember alike those who sought my life with stones , and those who gave me food aside , therefore , your fears . i return as an enemy only to those who injured me . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass and the charger . an ass congratulated a horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully provided for , while he himself had scarcely enough to eat and not even that without hard work . but when war broke out , a heavily armed soldier mounted the horse , and riding him to the charge , rushed into the very midst of the enemy . the horse was wounded and fell dead on the battlefield . then the ass , seeing all these things , changed his mind , and commiserated the horse . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the eagle and his captor . an eagle was once captured by a man , who immediately clipped his wings and put him into his poultry - yard with the other birds , at which treatment the eagle was weighed down with grief . later , another neighbor purchased him and allowed his feathers to grow again . the eagle took flight , and pouncing upon a hare , brought it at once as an offering to his benefactor . a fox , seeing this , exclaimed , do not cultivate the favor of this man , but of your former owner , lest he should again hunt for you and deprive you a second time of your wings . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the bald man and the fly . a fly bit the bare head of a bald man who , endeavoring to destroy it , gave himself a heavy slap . escaping , the fly said mockingly , you who have wished to revenge , even with death , the prick of a tiny insect , see what you have done to yourself to add insult to injury ? the bald man replied , i can easily make peace with myself , because i know there was no intention to hurt . but you , an ill - favored and contemptible insect who delights in sucking human blood , i wish that i could have killed you even if i had incurred a heavier penalty . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the olive - tree and the fig - tree . the olive - tree ridiculed the fig - tree because , while she was green all the year round , the fig - tree changed its leaves with the seasons . a shower of snow fell upon them , and , finding the olive full of foliage , it settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight , at once despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree . but finding the fig - tree denuded of leaves , the snow fell through to the ground , and did not injure it at all . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the eagle and the kite . an eagle , overwhelmed with sorrow , sat upon the branches of a tree in company with a kite . why , said the kite , do i see you with such a rueful look ? i seek , she replied , a mate suitable for me , and am not able to find one . take me , returned the kite , i am much stronger than you are . why , are you able to secure the means of living by your plunder ? well , i have often caught and carried away an ostrich in my talons . the eagle , persuaded by these words , accepted him as her mate . shortly after the nuptials , the eagle said , fly off and bring me back the ostrich you promised me . the kite , soaring aloft into the air , brought back the shabbiest possible mouse , stinking from the length of time it had lain about the fields . is this , said the eagle , the faithful fulfillment of your promise to me ? the kite replied , that i might attain your royal hand , there is nothing that i would not have promised , however much i knew that i must fail in the performance . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the ass and his driver . an ass , being driven along a high road , suddenly started off and bolted to the brink of a deep precipice . while he was in the act of throwing himself over , his owner seized him by the tail , endeavoring to pull him back . when the ass persisted in his effort , the man let him go and said , conquer , but conquer to your cost . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the thrush and the fowler . a thrush was feeding on a myrtle - tree and did not move from it because its berries were so delicious . a fowler observed her staying so long in one spot , and having well bird - limed his reeds , caught her . the thrush , being at the point of death , exclaimed , o foolish creature that i am ! for the sake of a little pleasant food i have deprived myself of my life . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the rose and the amaranth . an amaranth planted in a garden near a rose - tree , thus addressed it : what a lovely flower is the rose , a favorite alike with gods and with men . i envy you your beauty and your perfume . the rose replied , i indeed , dear amaranth , flourish but for a brief season ! if no cruel hand pluck me from my stem , yet i must perish by an early doom . but thou art immortal and dost never fade , but bloomest for ever in renewed youth . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | the frogs’ complaint against the sun . once upon a time , when the sun announced his intention to take a wife , the frogs lifted up their voices in clamor to the sky . jupiter , disturbed by the noise of their croaking , inquired the cause of their complaint . one of them said , the sun , now while he is single , parches up the marsh , and compels us to die miserably in our arid homes . what will be our future condition if he should beget other suns ? | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | . life of aesop . the life and history of æsop is involved , like that of homer , the most famous of greek poets , in much obscurity . sardis , the capital of lydia ; samos , a greek island ; mesembria , an ancient colony in thrace ; and cotiaeum , the chief city of a province of phrygia , contend for the distinction of being the birthplace of aesop . although the honor thus claimed cannot be definitely assigned to any one of these places , yet there are a few incidents now generally accepted by scholars as established facts , relating to the birth , life , and death of aesop . he is , by an almost universal consent , allowed to have been born about the year 620 b . c . , and to have been by birth a slave . he was owned by two masters in succession , both inhabitants of samos , xanthus and jadmon , the latter of whom gave him his liberty as a reward for his learning and wit . one of the privileges of a freedman in the ancient republics of greece , was the permission to take an active interest in public affairs ; and aesop , like the philosophers phaedo , menippus , and epictetus , in later times , raised himself from the indignity of a servile condition to a position of high renown . in his desire alike to instruct and to be instructed , he travelled through many countries , and among others came to sardis , the capital of the famous king of lydia , the great patron , in that day , of learning and of learned men . he met at the court of croesus with solon , thales , and other sages , and is related so to have pleased his royal master , by the part he took in the conversations held with these philosophers , that he applied to him an expression which has since passed into a proverb , μᾶλλον ὁ φρύξ . the phrygian has spoken better than all . on the invitation of croesus he fixed his residence at sardis , and was employed by that monarch in various difficult and delicate affairs of state . in his discharge of these commissions he visited the different petty republics of greece . at one time he is found in corinth , and at another in athens , endeavouring , by the narration of some of his wise fables , to reconcile the inhabitants of those cities to the administration of their respective rulers periander and pisistratus . one of these ambassadorial missions , undertaken at the command of croesus , was the occasion of his death . having been sent to delphi with a large sum of gold for distribution among the citizens , he was so provoked at their covetousness that he refused to divide the money , and sent it back to his master . the delphians , enraged at this treatment , accused him of impiety , and , in spite of his sacred character as ambassador , executed him as a public criminal . this cruel death of aesop was not unavenged . the citizens of delphi were visited with a series of calamities , until they made a public reparation of their crime ; and , the blood of aesop . became a well - known adage , bearing witness to the truth that deeds of wrong would not pass unpunished . neither did the great fabulist lack posthumous honors ; for a statue was erected to his memory at athens , the work of lysippus , one of the most famous of greek sculptors . phaedrus thus immortalizes the event : . aesopo ingentem statuam posuere attici , . servumque collocarunt aeterna in basi : . patere honoris scirent ut cuncti viam ; . nec generi tribui sed virtuti gloriam . these few facts are all that can be relied on with any degree of certainty , in reference to the birth , life , and death of aesop . they were first brought to light , after a patient search and diligent perusal of ancient authors , by a frenchman , m . claude gaspard bachet de mezeriac , who declined the honor of being tutor to louis xiii of france , from his desire to devote himself exclusively to literature . he published his life of aesop , anno domini 1632 . the later investigations of a host of english and german scholars have added very little to the facts given by m . mezeriac . the substantial truth of his statements has been confirmed by later criticism and inquiry . it remains to state , that prior to this publication of m . mezeriac , the life of aesop was from the pen of maximus planudes , a monk of constantinople , who was sent on an embassy to venice by the byzantine emperor andronicus the elder , and who wrote in the early part of the fourteenth century . his life was prefixed to all the early editions of these fables , and was republished as late as 1727 by archdeacon croxall as the introduction to his edition of aesop . this life by planudes contains , however , so small an amount of truth , and is so full of absurd pictures of the grotesque deformity of aesop , of wondrous apocryphal stories , of lying legends , and gross anachronisms , that it is now universally condemned as false , puerile , and unauthentic . [ 101 ] it is given up in the present day , by general consent , as unworthy of the slightest credit . g . f . t . | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | preface . the tale , the parable , and the fable are all common and popular modes of conveying instruction . each is distinguished by its own special characteristics . the tale consists simply in the narration of a story either founded on facts , or created solely by the imagination , and not necessarily associated with the teaching of any moral lesson . the parable is the designed use of language purposely intended to convey a hidden and secret meaning other than that contained in the words themselves ; and which may or may not bear a special reference to the hearer , or reader . the fable partly agrees with , and partly differs from both of these . it will contain , like the tale , a short but real narrative ; it will seek , like the parable , to convey a hidden meaning , and that not so much by the use of language , as by the skilful introduction of fictitious characters ; and yet unlike to either tale or parable , it will ever keep in view , as its high prerogative , and inseparable attribute , the great purpose of instruction , and will necessarily seek to inculcate some moral maxim , social duty , or political truth . the true fable , if it rise to its high requirements , ever aims at one great end and purpose representation of human motive , and the improvement of human conduct , and yet it so conceals its design under the disguise of fictitious characters , by clothing with speech the animals of the field , the birds of the air , the trees of the wood , or the beasts of the forest , that the reader shall receive advice without perceiving the presence of the adviser . thus the superiority of the counsellor , which often renders counsel unpalatable , is kept out of view , and the lesson comes with the greater acceptance when the reader is led , unconsciously to himself , to have his sympathies enlisted in behalf of what is pure , honorable , and praiseworthy , and to have his indignation excited against what is low , ignoble , and unworthy . the true fabulist , therefore , discharges a most important function . he is neither a narrator , nor an allegorist . he is a great teacher , a corrector of morals , a censor of vice , and a commender of virtue . in this consists the superiority of the fable over the tale or the parable . the fabulist is to create a laugh , but yet , under a merry guise , to convey instruction . phaedrus , the great imitator of aesop , plainly indicates this double purpose to be the true office of the writer of fables . duplex libelli dos est : quod risum movet , . et quod prudenti vitam consilio monet . the continual observance of this twofold aim creates the charm , and accounts for the universal favor , of the fables of aesop . the fable , . says professor k . o . mueller , originated in greece in an intentional travestie of human affairs . the ‘ainos , ’ as its name denotes , is an admonition , or rather a reproof veiled , either from fear of an excess of frankness , or from a love of fun and jest , beneath the fiction of an occurrence happening among beasts ; and wherever we have any ancient and authentic account of the aesopian fables , we find it to be the same . [ 1 ] . the construction of a fable involves a minute attention to ( 1 ) the narration itself ; ( 2 ) the deduction of the moral ; and ( 3 ) a careful maintenance of the individual characteristics of the fictitious personages introduced into it . the narration should relate to one simple action , consistent with itself , and neither be overladen with a multiplicity of details , nor distracted by a variety of circumstances . the moral or lesson should be so plain , and so intimately interwoven with , and so necessarily dependent on , the narration , that every reader should be compelled to give to it the same undeniable interpretation . the introduction of the animals or fictitious characters should be marked with an unexceptionable care and attention to their natural attributes , and to the qualities attributed to them by universal popular consent . the fox should be always cunning , the hare timid , the lion bold , the wolf cruel , the bull strong , the horse proud , and the ass patient . many of these fables are characterized by the strictest observance of these rules . they are occupied with one short narrative , from which the moral naturally flows , and with which it is intimately associated . ‘tis the simple manner , says dodsley , [ 2 ] in which the morals of aesop are interwoven with his fables that distinguishes him , and gives him the preference over all other mythologists . his ‘mountain delivered of a mouse , ’ produces the moral of his fable in ridicule of pompous pretenders ; and his crow , when she drops her cheese , lets fall , as it were by accident , the strongest admonition against the power of flattery . there is no need of a separate sentence to explain it ; no possibility of impressing it deeper , by that load we too often see of accumulated reflections . [ 3 ] an equal amount of praise is due for the consistency with which the characters of the animals , fictitiously introduced , are marked . while they are made to depict the motives and passions of men , they retain , in an eminent degree , their own special features of craft or counsel , of cowardice or courage , of generosity or rapacity . these terms of praise , it must be confessed , cannot be bestowed on all the fables in this collection . many of them lack that unity of design , that close connection of the moral with the narrative , that wise choice in the introduction of the animals , which constitute the charm and excellency of true aesopian fable . this inferiority of some to others is sufficiently accounted for in the history of the origin and descent of these fables . the great bulk of them are not the immediate work of aesop . many are obtained from ancient authors prior to the time in which he lived . thus , the fable of the hawk and the nightingale is related by hesiod ; [ 4 ] the eagle wounded by an arrow , winged with its own feathers , by aeschylus ; [ 5 ] the fox avenging his wrongs on the eagle , . by archilochus . [ 6 ] many of them again are of later origin , and are to be traced to the monks of the middle ages : and yet this collection , though thus made up of fables both earlier and later than the era of aesop , rightfully bears his name , because he composed so large a number ( all framed in the same mould , and conformed to the same fashion , and stamped with the same lineaments , image , and superscription ) as to secure to himself the right to be considered the father of greek fables , and the founder of this class of writing , which has ever since borne his name , and has secured for him , through all succeeding ages , the position of the first of moralists . [ 7 ] . the fables were in the first instance only narrated by aesop , and for a long time were handed down by the uncertain channel of oral tradition . socrates is mentioned by plato [ 8 ] as having employed his time while in prison , awaiting the return of the sacred ship from delphos which was to be the signal of his death , in turning some of these fables into verse , but he thus versified only such as he remembered . demetrius phalereus , a philosopher at athens about 300 b . c . , is said to have made the first collection of these fables . phaedrus , a slave by birth or by subsequent misfortunes , and admitted by augustus to the honors of a freedman , imitated many of these fables in latin iambics about the commencement of the christian era . aphthonius , a rhetorician of antioch , a . d . 315 , wrote a treatise on , and converted into latin prose , some of these fables . this translation is the more worthy of notice , as it illustrates a custom of common use , both in these and in later times . the rhetoricians and philosophers were accustomed to give the fables of aesop as an exercise to their scholars , not only inviting them to discuss the moral of the tale , but also to practice and to perfect themselves thereby in style and rules of grammar , by making for themselves new and various versions of the fables . ausonius , [ 9 ] the friend of the emperor valentinian , and the latest poet of eminence in the western empire , has handed down some of these fables in verse , which julianus titianus , a contemporary writer of no great name , translated into prose . avienus , also a contemporary of ausonius , put some of these fables into latin elegiacs , which are given by nevelet ( in a book we shall refer to hereafter ) , and are occasionally incorporated with the editions of phaedrus . seven centuries elapsed before the next notice is found of the fables of aesop . during this long period these fables seem to have suffered an eclipse , to have disappeared and to have been forgotten ; and it is at the commencement of the fourteenth century , when the byzantine emperors were the great patrons of learning , and amidst the splendors of an asiatic court , that we next find honors paid to the name and memory of aesop . maximus planudes , a learned monk of constantinople , made a collection of about a hundred and fifty of these fables . little is known of his history . planudes , however , was no mere recluse , shut up in his monastery . he took an active part in public affairs . in 1327 a . d . he was sent on a diplomatic mission to venice by the emperor andronicus the elder . this brought him into immediate contact with the western patriarch , whose interests he henceforth advocated with so much zeal as to bring on him suspicion and persecution from the rulers of the eastern church . planudes has been exposed to a two - fold accusation . he is charged on the one hand with having had before him a copy of babrias ( to whom we shall have occasion to refer at greater length in the end of this preface ) , and to have had the bad taste to transpose , or to turn his poetical version into prose : and he is asserted , on the other hand , never to have seen the fables of aesop at all , but to have himself invented and made the fables which he palmed off under the name of the famous greek fabulist . the truth lies between these two extremes . planudes may have invented some few fables , or have inserted some that were current in his day ; but there is an abundance of unanswerable internal evidence to prove that he had an acquaintance with the veritable fables of aesop , although the versions he had access to were probably corrupt , as contained in the various translations and disquisitional exercises of the rhetoricians and philosophers . his collection is interesting and important , not only as the parent source or foundation of the earlier printed versions of aesop , but as the direct channel of attracting to these fables the attention of the learned . the eventual re - introduction , however , of these fables of aesop to their high place in the general literature of christendom , is to be looked for in the west rather than in the east . the calamities gradually thickening round the eastern empire , and the fall of constantinople , 1453 a . d . combined with other events to promote the rapid restoration of learning in italy ; and with that recovery of learning the revival of an interest in the fables of aesop is closely identified . these fables , indeed , were among the first writings of an earlier antiquity that attracted attention . they took their place beside the holy scriptures and the ancient classic authors , in the minds of the great students of that day . lorenzo valla , one of the most famous promoters of italian learning , not only translated into latin the iliad of homer and the histories of herodotus and thucydides , but also the fables of aesop . these fables , again , were among the books brought into an extended circulation by the agency of the printing press . bonus accursius , as early as 1475 - 1480 , printed the collection of these fables , made by planudes , which , within five years afterwards , caxton translated into english , and printed at his press in west - minster abbey , 1485 . [ 10 ] it must be mentioned also that the learning of this age has left permanent traces of its influence on these fables , [ 11 ] by causing the interpolation with them of some of those amusing stories which were so frequently introduced into the public discourses of the great preachers of those days , and of which specimens are yet to be found in the extant sermons of jean raulin , meffreth , and gabriel barlette . [ 12 ] the publication of this era which most probably has influenced these fables , is the liber facetiarum , [ 13 ] a book consisting of a hundred jests and stories , by the celebrated poggio bracciolini , published a . d . 1471 , from which the two fables of the miller , his son , and the ass , and the fox and the woodcutter , are undoubtedly selected . the knowledge of these fables rapidly spread from italy into germany , and their popularity was increased by the favor and sanction given to them by the great fathers of the reformation , who frequently used them as vehicles for satire and protest against the tricks and abuses of the romish ecclesiastics . the zealous and renowned camerarius , who took an active part in the preparation of the confession of augsburgh , found time , amidst his numerous avocations , to prepare a version for the students in the university of tubingen , in which he was a professor . martin luther translated twenty of these fables , and was urged by melancthon to complete the whole ; while gottfried arnold , the celebrated lutheran theologian , and librarian to frederick i , king of prussia , mentions that the great reformer valued the fables of aesop next after the holy scriptures . in 1546 a . d . the second printed edition of the collection of the fables made by planudes , was issued from the printing - press of robert stephens , in which were inserted some additional fables from a ms . in the bibliotheque du roy at paris . the greatest advance , however , towards a re - introduction of the fables of aesop to a place in the literature of the world , was made in the early part of the seventeenth century . in the year 1610 , a learned swiss , isaac nicholas nevelet , sent forth the third printed edition of these fables , in a work entitled mythologia aesopica . this was a noble effort to do honor to the great fabulist , and was the most perfect collection of aesopian fables ever yet published . it consisted , in addition to the collection of fables given by planudes and reprinted in the various earlier editions , of one hundred and thirty - six new fables ( never before published ) from mss . in the library of the vatican , of forty fables attributed to aphthonius , and of forty - three from babrias . it also contained the latin versions of the same fables by phaedrus , avienus , and other authors . this volume of nevelet forms a complete corpus fabularum aesopicarum ; and to his labors aesop owes his restoration to universal favor as one of the wise moralists and great teachers of mankind . during the interval of three centuries which has elapsed since the publication of this volume of nevelet’s , no book , with the exception of the holy scriptures , has had a wider circulation than aesop’s fables . they have been translated into the greater number of the languages both of europe and of the east , and have been read , and will be read , for generations , alike by jew , heathen , mohammedan , and christian . they are , at the present time , not only engrafted into the literature of the civilized world , but are familiar as household words in the common intercourse and daily conversation of the inhabitants of all countries . this collection of nevelet’s is the great culminating point in the history of the revival of the fame and reputation of aesopian fables . it is remarkable , also , as containing in its preface the germ of an idea , which has been since proved to have been correct by a strange chain of circumstances . nevelet intimates an opinion , that a writer named babrias would be found to be the veritable author of the existing form of aesopian fables . this intimation has since given rise to a series of inquiries , the knowledge of which is necessary , in the present day , to a full understanding of the true position of aesop in connection with the writings that bear his name . the history of babrias is so strange and interesting , that it might not unfitly be enumerated among the curiosities of literature . he is generally supposed to have been a greek of asia minor , of one of the ionic colonies , but the exact period in which he lived and wrote is yet unsettled . he is placed , by one critic , [ 14 ] as far back as the institution of the achaian league , b . c . 250 ; by another as late as the emperor severus , who died a . d . 235 ; while others make him a contemporary with phaedrus in the time of augustus . at whatever time he wrote his version of aesop , by some strange accident it seems to have entirely disappeared , and to have been lost sight of . his name is mentioned by avienus ; by suidas , a celebrated critic , at the close of the eleventh century , who gives in his lexicon several isolated verses of his version of the fables ; and by john tzetzes , a grammarian and poet of constantinople , who lived during the latter half of the twelfth century . nevelet , in the preface to the volume which we have described , points out that the fables of planudes could not be the work of aesop , as they contain a reference in two places to holy monks , and give a verse from the epistle of st . james as an epimith to one of the fables , and suggests babrias as their author . francis vavassor , [ 15 ] a learned french jesuit , entered at greater length on this subject , and produced further proofs from internal evidence , from the use of the word piraeus in describing the harbour of athens , a name which was not given till two hundred years after aesop , and from the introduction of other modern words , that many of these fables must have been at least committed to writing posterior to the time of aesop , and more boldly suggests babrias as their author or collector . [ 16 ] these various references to babrias induced dr . plichard bentley , at the close of the seventeenth century , to examine more minutely the existing versions of aesop’s fables , and he maintained that many of them could , with a slight change of words , be resolved into the scazonic [ 17 ] iambics , in which babrias is known to have written : and , with a greater freedom than the evidence then justified , he put forth , in behalf of babrias , a claim to the exclusive authorship of these fables . such a seemingly extravagant theory , thus roundly asserted , excited much opposition . dr . bentley [ 18 ] met with an able antagonist in a member of the university of oxford , the hon . mr . charles boyle , [ 19 ] afterwards earl of orrery . their letters and disputations on this subject , enlivened on both sides with much wit and learning , will ever bear a conspicuous place in the literary history of the seventeenth century . the arguments of dr . bentley were yet further defended a few years later by mr . thomas tyrwhitt , a well - read scholar , who gave up high civil distinctions that he might devote himself the more unreservedly to literary pursuits . mr . tyrwhitt published , a . d . 1776 , a dissertation on babrias , and a collection of his fables in choliambic meter found in a ms . in the bodleian library at oxford . francesco de furia , a learned italian , contributed further testimony to the correctness of the supposition that babrias had made a veritable collection of fables by printing from a ms . contained in the vatican library several fables never before published . in the year 1844 , however , new and unexpected light was thrown upon this subject . a veritable copy of babrias was found in a manner as singular as were the mss . of quinctilian’s institutes , and of cicero’s orations by poggio in the monastery of st . gall a . d . 1416 . m . menoides , at the suggestion of m . villemain , minister of public instruction to king louis philippe , had been entrusted with a commission to search for ancient mss . , and in carrying out his instructions he found a ms . at the convent of st . laura , on mount athos , which proved to be a copy of the long suspected and wished - for choliambic version of babrias . this ms . was found to be divided into two books , the one containing a hundred and twenty - five , and the other ninety - five fables . this discovery attracted very general attention , not only as confirming , in a singular manner , the conjectures so boldly made by a long chain of critics , but as bringing to light valuable literary treasures tending to establish the reputation , and to confirm the antiquity and authenticity of the great mass of aesopian fable . the fables thus recovered were soon published . they found a most worthy editor in the late distinguished sir george cornewall lewis , and a translator equally qualified for his task , in the reverend james davies , m . a . , sometime a scholar of lincoln college , oxford , and himself a relation of their english editor . thus , after an eclipse of many centuries , babrias shines out as the earliest , and most reliable collector of veritable aesopian fables . the following are the sources from which the present translation has been prepared : . babrii fabulae aesopeae . george cornewall lewis . oxford , 1846 . babrii fabulae aesopeae . e codice manuscripto partem secundam edidit . george cornewall lewis . london : parker , 1857 . mythologica aesopica . opera et studia isaaci nicholai neveleti . frankfort , 1610 . fabulae aesopiacae , quales ante planudem ferebantur cura et studio . francisci de furia . lipsiae , 1810 . - - - - - - . ex recognitione caroli halmii . lipsiae , phaedri fabulae esopiae . delphin classics . 1822 . george fyler townsend | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | '"
